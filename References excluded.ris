N2  - Immigrant caregivers face unique difficulties in self-care and caregiving practices in the United States. Our aim was to conduct an evaluation of the content of a training curriculum app designed for Chinese immigrant caregivers based on the Body-Mind-Spirit model. An app prototype was developed, and a sample content was examined by prospective users accessing it on their smartphones. Using a participatory design approach, 22 in-depth interviews were conducted with Chinese immigrant caregivers in Los Angeles in 2019, and feedback for spirituality content was sought from an independent expert. Caregivers provided feedback for three self-care categories-body, mind, and community resources-and two caregiving content categories-knowledge and skills, and community resources. From this feedback, five areas for designing training curriculum content emerged: caregiving stress, lifestyle and health behavior change, access to community resources, death education and end-of-life care, and spiritual care.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - It is widely recognised that employment is vital in assisting young refugees' integration into a new society. Drawing on psychosocial safety climate (PSC) theory, this research investigated the effect of organisational climate on young refugee workers' mental health (psychological dis-tress) through stressful social relational aspects of work (e.g., harassment, discrimination). Drawing on data from 635 young refugees aged between 15 and 26 in South Australia, 116 refugees with paid work were compared with 519 refugee students without work, and a sample of young workers from Australian Workplace Barometer (AWB) data (n = 290). The results indicated that refugees with paid work had significantly lower psychological distress compared with refugees with no paid work, but more distress than other young Australian workers. With respect to workplace harassment and abuse, young refugee workers reported significantly more harassment due to their ongoing interaction and engagement with mainstream Australian workers compared with unemployed refugees. Harassment played a vital role in affecting psychological health in refugees (particularly) and other young workers. While refugee youth experienced harassment at work, overall, their experiences suggest that their younger age upon arrival enabled them to seek and find positive employment outcomes. Although PSC did not differ significantly between the employed groups, we found that it likely negatively influenced psychological distress through the mediating effects of harassment and abuse. Hence, fostering pathways to successful employment and creating safe work based on high PSC and less harassment are strongly recommended to improve refugees' mental health and adaptation.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - This study evaluated the feasibility of Family Empowerment (FAME), a preventive multifamily program for asylum seeker families in the Netherlands. FAME aims to reinforce the parent-child relationship, family functioning, and social support. We used an uncontrolled pre-test-post-test design, embedded in a mixed-methods approach. FAME was offered to 46 asylum seeker families, mostly originating from Eritrea, Armenia, or Syria. Twenty-seven parents gave consent to participate in this study. Program integrity and evaluations of participating parents and trainers were assessed. Family functioning and parental symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured pre- and post-FAME. Six participants completed all assessments. Most participants valued gathering with multiple families. Although FAME might coincide with decreases in anxiety and depression, the program had a limited impact on family functioning. Possibly, the aims of FAME did not align with some families' current needs. Lessons learned and recommendations to further improve interventions for refugee families are discussed.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Guided by the theories of human capital and acculturation, this study investigated the association of immigrant status among older people with their physical and mental health outcomes, health services utilization, and health insurance coverage. Specifically, it examined the interactive effects of immigrant status, education, acculturation, race, and ethnicity on these dependent variables. The study used a national representation sample of 7,345 older Americans from the first wave of the Asset and Health Dynamic of the Oldest Old study (AHEAD) survey. We used both logistic regression and ordered logit regression for our multivariate analyses. The findings are as follows: (1) immigrant status was negatively associated with level of depression, number of IADL difficulties, and on types of health insurance coverage. Immigrant status had a significant relationship only with the utilization of outpatient surgery, but not on other health services utilization. (2) There were significant interactive effects of race and ethnicity and immigrant status on these dependent variables. The findings support the existence of double jeopardy among those who are simultaneously an immigrant and a member of a racial and ethnic minority group in the United States. (3) Acculturation has strong associations with health insurance coverage and with number of difficulties with IADL. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Research shows that one in four migrant farmworkers experienced an episode of one or more mental health disorders such as stress, depression, or anxiety in their lifetime. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to explore experiences and perceptions related to stress and depression among Latino migrant and seasonal farmworkers (MSFWs), and to identify their coping behaviors for dealing with these mental health conditions. Using a mixed methods research approach, three focus group interviews of a sample of Latino MSFWs (N = 29) were conducted and a quantitative survey was implemented (N = 57) at community sites in eastern North Carolina. Four major themes emerged from the focus group data: (1) physical stress related to working conditions; (2) mental stress related to family situations, work environment, documentation status, and lack of resources; (3) depression related to separation from family and the lack of resources; and (4) use of positive and negative mechanisms for coping with stress and depression. A discussion of these themes, results from the survey findings, implications for intervention and outreach programs, along with recommendations for further research, are provided. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - In this study, using SHARE data we examined whether the education of adult children is associated with depressive symptoms (EURO-D caseness) for older immigrants and nonimmigrants in Europe. After controlling for possible confounders, we found that the education of adult children has independent effects on the mental health of their parents, and that having children with upper secondary or tertiary levels of education significantly lessen the odds of immigrants experiencing depressive symptoms. Furthermore, regular contact between parents and their adult children exerts a positive influence as well as amplifying the relationship between children's education and mental health. Taken together, the results demonstrate that, were it not for family social capital, older immigrants might experience much worse mental health outcomes.Copyright © 2016 Hogrefe.

N2  - Latinx immigrant families are greatly impacted by US policies and practices that limit immigrant families and children's rights. This article reviews the effects of such policies and the growing literature examining migration experiences. Latinx immigrant youth and parents may encounter multiple stressors across the stages of migration, including physical and structural violence, fear, poverty, and discrimination, which contribute to higher rates of mental health problems in this population. Despite significant trauma exposure, immigrants demonstrate incredible resilience within themselves, their families, and their communities and through movements and policies aimed at protecting their rights. Numerous culturally relevant universal, targeted, and intensive interventions were developed to magnify these protective factors to promote healing, advance immigration reform, and provide trauma-informed training and psychoeducation. Psychologistsplay a crucial role in implementing, evaluating, and advocating for accessible and collaborative approaches to care so that Latinx immigrant families have the resources to combat the harmful sequelae of immigration stress.Copyright © 2021 Annual Reviews Inc..

N2  - Knowledge and identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are increasing in Latin America, yet there are limited resources available to help families of children with ASD. For this study, researchers adapted and tested a parent educational program created for Latino immigrant parents of children with ASD in the United States to the needs of parents of children with ASD in Colombia. Parents were randomized into two intervention delivery modes, one led by parents and the other by students. All measures were self-reported by parents (n = 20). Parents improved in understanding their child's strengths and needs and frequency of using evidence-based strategies. Parents in the student-led group reported significantly lower depressive symptoms between baseline and follow-up. In focus groups, parents expressed satisfaction with the intervention and described ways they were using the information. This study demonstrated promising results to improve the experience of parents of children with ASD in Colombia.Copyright © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2021.

N2  - Research has found that 24% of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore have poor mental health (24%), with depressive symptoms being identified as the second most severe psychological symptoms [1]. The study assessed the acceptability and effectiveness of a 4-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based paraprofessional training program for FDWs in Singapore on depression literacy and CBT knowledge (primary outcomes), depression-related stigma, as well as attitudes towards seeking professional help (secondary outcomes) immediately and 2 months following the training. Forty female Filipino FDWs were recruited and randomized into either a CBT-based paraprofessional training program or wait-list (WL) group. Participants completed outcome measures before, after, and 2 months following their training. No significant difference was found on changes on any of the outcome variables in the intervention group as compared to the WL group. Following training, both groups showed significantly improved depression literacy, CBT knowledge, and attitudes towards seeking professional help. These changes were sustained at 2-month follow-up. All participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the training program. While findings from between-group analyses do not support the efficacy of the CBT-based paraprofessional training program in improving depression literacy and related outcomes, participation in the program was associated with improvements in several outcomes within the training group. Future research should explore adaptations to the program (e.g., in terms of training duration and modes of delivery) that would increase its efficacy in improving depression literacy and CBT knowledge among FDWs.

N2  - Background: Precarious employment has become an urgent public health issue at a global scale with potential consequences for quality of life and health of employees, especially in vulnerable groups such as migrants. The primary aim of this systematic review is thus to analyze and summarize existing research on the association between precarious employment and migrant workers' mental health. Method(s): We will search PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science (from January 1970 onwards) for original articles on observational studies (e.g., cohort, case-control and cross-sectional, and qualitative) published in English, German, Turkish, and Spanish. The primary outcome will be depression and anxiety disorders. Secondary outcomes will be burnout, sleeping problems, and occupational stress. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. The methodological quality (or risk of bias) of individual studies will be appraised using an appropriate tool. A narrative synthesis will summarize and explain the characteristics and findings of the studies. If feasible, we will conduct random effects meta-analyses where appropriate. Discussion(s): This systematic review will analyze the ways in which precarious employment affects migrant workers' mental health and the process that underlies this relationship. The results from the systematic review outlined in this protocol will be of interest to labor and health professionals, policy makers, labor unions, and non-governmental organizations. Our findings may encourage and impel related policy makers to establish human-focused, safe and healthy work environments, and workplace conditions.

N2  - Purpose: Drawing from major theoretical and conceptual frameworks on minority men's mental health, we designed the current observational study to assess the associations of gender norms, discrimination, and acculturation with clinically significant depressive symptoms (CESD>=16) among a sample of immigrant Latino men in North Carolina. Method(s): We used data from a baseline survey of men (n=111) recruited for a peer-led health intervention. To assess the associations with depressive symptoms, we performed descriptive and bivariate analyses, followed by multiple logistic regression. Result(s): Men in the sample tended to be young (mean age 18.5 years), recent immigrants (70.3% immigrated after age 16), and to have incomplete high school education (76.5%). About half (51.4%) reported experiencing discrimination due to their ethnicity and more than a third (37.8%) reported experiencing discrimination due to their race. Using the short form Conformity to Masculine Norms instrument, their mean masculinity score was 52.0; their average 12-item Short Acculturation Scale for Latinos score was 21.8. More than one-quarter of participants (26.1%) had clinically significant depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression models showed among this sample of immigrant Latino men in the Southeast, traditional masculine norms-but not perceived discrimination nor acculturation-were associated with clinically significant depressive symptoms. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest a potential future avenue for intervention research: testing whether changing gender norms could result in improvements to mental health.Copyright © 2020 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc..

N2  - Background: To explore the characteristics and compare clinical outcomes of non-Australian born (migrant) and Australian-born users of an Australian national digital mental health service. Method(s): The characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients who completed online treatment at the MindSpot Clinic between January 2014 and December 2016 and reported a country of birth other than Australia were compared to Australian-born users. Data about the main language spoken at home were used to create distinct groups. Changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale - 7 Item (GAD-7), respectively. Result(s): Of 52,020 people who started assessment at MindSpot between 1st January 2014 and 22nd December 2016, 45,082 reported a country of birth, of whom 78.6% (n = 35,240) were Australian-born, and 21.4% (n = 9842) were born overseas. Of 6782 people who completed the online treatment and reported country of birth and main language spoken at home, 1631 (24%) were migrants, 960 (59%) were from English-speaking countries, and 671 (41%) were from non-English speaking countries. Treatment-seeking migrant users reported higher rates of tertiary education than Australian-born users. The baseline symptom severity, and rates of symptom reduction and remission following online treatment were similar across groups. Conclusion(s): Online treatment was associated with significant reductions in anxiety and depression in migrants of both English speaking and non-English speaking backgrounds, with outcomes similar to those obtained by Australian-born patients. DMHS have considerable potential to help reduce barriers to mental health care for migrants.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Background Women's participation in decision-making in the household is an indicator of women's empowerment. Few studies have compared domestic decision-making power and its effect on postpartum health between immigrant and native-born women. This study aimed to examine the effect of domestic decision-making power and social support during pregnancy on predicting postpartum depressive and physical symptoms among immigrant and nativeborn mothers in Taiwan. Methods and findings This prospective study recruited 177 marriage-based immigrant mothers and 230 nativeborn women who were at least twelve weeks pregnant from hospitals, clinics and health centers. Data were collected in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum from March 2013 to March 2015. Postpartum depression and the severity of postpartum physical symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and a 17-item, 4-point Likert scale, respectively. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between "domestic decision-making power and social support during pregnancy" and "depressive and physical symptoms at 3 months postpartum." Women who had lower domestic decision-making power and social support during pregnancy had higher postpartum depressive and physical symptoms. Those women with full-time employment and insufficient family income had higher postpartum depressive symptoms. Though immigrant women scored lower in domestic decision-making power and social support than native-born women, they had lower mean scores in postpartum depressive and physical symptoms. After accounting for the abovementioned factors, immigrant women remained at lower risk for postpartum depressive and physical symptoms than native-born women. There was significant interaction between domestic decision-making power and immigrant status, suggesting that the association between domestic decision-making and postpartum depressive and physical symptoms was smaller for immigrants than for native women. Conclusions Domestic decision-making power and social support during pregnancy are protective predictors of postpartum depressive and physical symptoms. However, the effect of domestic decision-making power appeared to be less salient for immigrants, probably due to the "healthy immigrant effect" and/or lower expectations toward domestic decision-making power among immigrants. The finding that immigrant women demonstrated a lower level of domestic decision-making power suggests that empowerment issues need to be addressed among immigrants.Copyright © 2020 Chen, Chien.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Refugee health professionals experience several barriers on their path to re-entering their original occupations in host countries. Several training programmes exist in order to address these barriers and enable a successful labour market integration. Objective(s): This study aims to evaluate a specific orientation programme for the labour market integration of refugee health professionals in Germany. The programme lasts three months and comprises three elements (German technical terminology language course, cross-cultural coaching and a job shadowing). Design(s): A mixed-methods design was implemented to evaluate the programme. To assess participants' skills improvement and satisfaction, self-developed questionnaires were used. For in-depth-evaluation of individual experiences, qualitative interviews were conducted at four time points (pre, half-time, post, follow-up) with both programme participants and programme providers about their experiences. Result(s): Participants described impacts on their personal situation and improvement of their language, professional and formal skills. Some participants also described negative effects mostly due to unsupervised shadowing. Additional barriers, such as cost of travel were identified as challenges for participation. Conclusion(s): Training programmes may affect language skills, professional skills and formal resources. However, programme providers need to anticipate negative effects and introduce actions for preventing negative outcomes. Moreover, programmes should be designed to reduce work-related fear and anxiety amongst participants.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) comprise one of the largest populations of migrant workers globally. Within China, they represent the largest group of imported domestic workers. Little is known about their working conditions or how this might affect their health and wellbeing. METHOD(S): This qualitative study explored the working conditions and risk factors for poor health in a sample of temporary female Filipino domestic workers in Macao, China. Focus group discussions with female domestic workers (n=22) and in-depth interviews with key informants (n=7) were conducted. RESULT(S): Domestic workers reported physical (e.g., hypertension, chronic pain, diabetes, poor sleep), and mental health problems (depression, anxiety), and addictive behaviors (gambling, alcohol misuse), along with significant structural, linguistic, financial, and cultural barriers to healthcare access to address these concerns. Adverse working conditions including poor treatment and abuse by employers, lack of privacy and inadequate sleeping areas in employers' homes or in crowded boarding houses, language barriers, inadequate and poor enforcement of labor protections, and discrimination. Domestic workers also cited exorbitant agency fees and remittances causing significant financial stress. Kinship network ties with family members back home were fraught with infidelity, difficulty parenting, misuse of remittances, and family misconceptions of domestic workers' situation abroad. Lack of quality social support and peer social networks exacerbated these conditions. CONCLUSION(S): In this sample of Filipino migrant domestic workers, stressors experienced within the host country were commonly reported. Indebtedness and low salaries limits social mobility. Psychosocial and policy-level interventions are needed to improve the health and wellbeing of this population of migrant women.

TI  - 43.3 ENGAGING IMMIGRANT LATINA MOTHERS IN MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION IN PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SETTINGS
AU  - Platt, Rheanna

PY  - 2020

N2  - Objectives: Postpartum depression can have far-reaching effects on family and child mental health and functioning. Immigrant Latinas are at elevated risk for postpartum depression but are less likely to receive treatment. New models of care are needed to engage this population more effectively. We explored 2 avenues to promote engagement of immigrant Latina mothers in mental health care (including preventive interventions): group pediatric well-child visits and service provision within early childhood education centers. Method(s): We interviewed 9 providers and participants (N = 6/14) in group well-child visits and observed 7 Spanish-language cohorts at the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-month visits. We also conducted interviews with 14 mothers at an "Early Childhood Learning Hub" without maternal mental health programming. Interviews focused on feasibility and acceptability of addressing maternal mental health in these settings as well as recommendations for engaging families. Observations focused on strategies used to discuss psychosocial topics such as postpartum depression. Thematic analysis of observations and interviews was conducted. Result(s): Within group well-child care, providers perceived a unique benefit to peer testimony as well as to a group discussion contextualizing the postpartum depression screening process. This was accomplished via a more culturally relevant presentation of the rationale for screening and the impact of parent mental health on child development. Discussion about maternal well-being was well-received by participants and viewed as unique to the group visit setting. In observations, providers explicitly framed their role as supporting the family in the service of the child's health and development. In Early Childhood Learning Hubs, parents described being able to better parent or support their child as a primary motivator for potential participation in a maternal mental health-focused intervention. Conclusion(s): Settings focused on child health and development/education represent a unique and important venue in which to engage mothers. Explicitly framing maternal mental health screening and intervention as being in the service of the child's health, development, or educational attainment may be an effective tool for engaging immigrant Latina mothers.

N2  - Objectives/Background: Cognitive behavioural interventions have been shown to be an effective verbal therapy for post-natal mental health distress. There is a high prevalence of perinatal mood and anxiety disorder (PMAD) symptoms among new mothers in Israel, particularly in specific ethnocultural groups. TheWAWA program was developed in Australia to provide a low-cost and accessible method for reaching mothers who may not be able to come into clinics for treatment for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. The aim of the current studywas to assess the feasibility, acceptability and safety of theWAWA among community-dwelling women in the firstmonths after the birth of a child. Method(s): A single group pre-and post-test designwas selected and women were invited to participate if theymet the criteria of: Hebrew-speaking, community-residing, over age 18, without known diagnosed psychiatric conditions and who had given birth to a childwithin the last threemonths. Respondents participated in one small group session to explain the purpose of the study and those agreeing signed informed consent. Baseline questionnaires included the General Anxiety Questionnaire (GAD), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale - DASS 21, and Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale (EPDS) and socio-demographic data. Participants took part, in groups of three, in an introductory session of 90 minutes. The following four sessions and a follow-up interview were conducted over the phone, individually with a MA level mental health professional who received supervision on her work. At the last session, the respondents filled out the questionnaire a second time. Result(s): Ten women participated and provided follow-up data. The sample consisted ofmarried, Jewishwomen,mean age 31.1 (s.d. 6.3 years, range 22- 42), 50%were Israeli born and 50%were immigrants, 70% reported low SES and 60% were religious. All participants had completed at least 12 years of education, average 14.1 (s.d. 2.0 years). While all participants reported that they felt they had some symptoms of PMAD, the EPDS showed that only 40% had scores of 12 and over (mean EPDS 7.8, s.d.=5.5, range 0-14).GAD scores were (mean =6.0, s.d. 4.2), DASS21 (mean=13.3, s.d. 8.4). High correlations were found between the three mental health measures (rs=0.72- 0.88) suggesting high multi-collinearity. Discussion and conclusion: These preliminary findings indicate that the WAWA intervention in Hebrew is feasible, acceptable and safe for use among Israeli women grappling with significant perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. Further research using a randomized controlled trial and a larger sample is warranted.

TI  - 'Koro and Migration': Observational study of an outbreak of Koro in a migrant population working in South India
AU  - Anonymous.
PY  - 2020
PD  - /
N2  - Introduction Koro is a culture-bound syndrome, common in India, characterized by the belief that one's genitals are shrinking followed by fear of impending death. Signifcant social stressors can precipitate this syndrome in vulnerable populations. One such factor is migration which is associated with increased vulnerability to neurosis and poor coping. It has been a less studied factor in the genesis of Koro and the same has been explored in the present study. Method There was an outbreak of Koro (13 cases: M:8, F:5) among a population (n=52) from east and middle India who had migrated to the south for manual work. These cases presented in clusters to our Psychiatry outpatient department within a span of two weeks. We did an observational study to explore the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of these patients. Their perceptions and attributions to the illness were also studied. Results Most patients were married men with lower socio-economic status and no formal education. More females were however affected than earlier reported data. Most patients knew about the illness and believed that it was contagious. Death anxiety, loss of libido and insomnia were common associated complaints. Males feared loss of impotence whereas females feared of 'loss of child-bearing' abilities. The major attributing factors to the illness were migration, the stigma of working near a 'mental hospital' and sharing shelter with the affected. Pharmacotherapy and single-session cognitive behavioural therapy were used for treatment. Conclusions Our study revealed unique clinical correlates and belief-systems of patients affected with Koro. It is time we stop seeing it just as 'culture-bound syndrome' but also a social disorder caused by distortion of body-related beliefs. Migration being a signifcant environmental factor can often precipitate such culture-bound syndromes. Further mixed-method studies are warranted.

N2  - AimsCommon mental disorders are highly prevalent among Syrian refugees. Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a brief, transdiagnostic, non-specialist helper delivered, psychological intervention targeting psychological distress. This single-blind pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) on PM+ delivered by peer-refugees examined trial procedures in advance of a definitive RCT, evaluated PM+ 's acceptability and feasibility, investigated its likely effectiveness and cost-effectiveness among Syrian refugees in the Netherlands.MethodsAdult Syrian refugees (N = 60) with elevated psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) score >15) and reduced pychosocial functioning (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS) score >16) were randomised into PM+ in addition to care as usual (CAU) (PM+/CAU; n = 30) or CAU alone (n = 30). Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Checklist; HSCL-25) at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were pychosocial functioning (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule; WHODAS 2.0), symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD Checklist for DSM 5; PCL-5) and self-identified problems (Psychological Outcomes Profiles; PSYCHLOPS). Changes in service utilisation and time out of employment and/or adult education were estimated (adapted version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory; CSRI). Semi-structured interviews on the implementation of PM+ were conducted with stakeholders (i.e. six PM+ participants, five non-specialist helpers and five key informants).ResultsRecruitment, randomization and blinding procedures were successful. PM+ was generally perceived positively by stakeholders, especially regarding the intervention strategies, accommodation of the intervention and the helpers. Two serious adverse events not attributable to the trial were reported. At 3-month follow-up, the HSCL-25 total score was significantly lower for the PM+/CAU group (n = 30) than CAU group (n = 30) (p = 0.004; d = 0.58). Significant differences in favour of PM+/CAU were also found for WHODAS psychosocial functioning (p = 0.009, d = 0.73), PCL-5 symptoms of PTSD (p = 0.006, d = 0.66) and PSYCHLOPS self-identified problems (p = 0.005, d = 0.81). There were no significant differences in mean health service costs (p = 0.191) and the mean costs of lost productive time (p = 0.141). This suggests PM+ may potentially be cost-effective with an incremental cost from a health system perspective of 5047 (95% CI 0-19 773) per additional recovery achieved.ConclusionsTrial procedures and PM+ delivered by non-specialist peer-refugee helpers seemed acceptable, feasible and safe. Analyses indicate that PM+ may be effective in improving mental health outcomes and psychosocial functioning, potentially cost-effective. These results support the development of a definitive RCT with a larger sample of refugees and a longer follow-up period. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020. Published by Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Introduction: Previous studies indicated that living and working environments have influence on depression. However, there are limited studies on the association between living and working environments and depressive symptoms among Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand. Aim(s): This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and influence of living and working environments on depressive symptoms among Myanmar migrant workers in the South of Thailand. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 1,022 Myanmar migrants who were selected by using a multi-stage random sampling technique. A structured questionnaire was developed and used for interviewing the participants. The multilevel logistic regression was performed to determine the association between living and working environments and depressive symptoms when controlling other covariates. Result(s): The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 53.03% (95% CI: 49.96-56.09). Living and working environments significantly associated with depressive symptoms were; moderate to severe problems on living conditions (adj. OR=2.45; 95% CI: 1.55-3.86, p-value <0.001), the limitation in traveling (adj. OR=2.28; 95%CI: 1.47-3.53, p-value <0.001), high level of involvement with peers (adj. OR=1.61; 95% CI: 1.20-2.16, p-value=0.001) and indoor workplace (adj. OR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.17-2.18, p-value=0.003). Significant other covariates were; chronic diseases and received health information. Conclusion(s): Depressive symptoms were common among Myanmar migrants in the South of Thailand. Living and working conditions, social interaction and health awareness had influenced their mental health status.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research. All rights reserved.

N2  - The present study aimed to explore the coping resources and mental health of women who have fled Syria to a neighboring European country. To that end, we examined the roles of sociodemographic factors, situational factors, and personal and community sense of coherence (SOC and ComSOC, respectively) in mental-health outcomes. One hundred and eleven refugee women aged 19-70 filled out self-reported questionnaires during August 2018 in a refugee camp in Greece. The questionnaires asked the participants for demographic information (i.e., age, level of education level, and time spent in the camp) and also addressed the situational factors of having received aid from various organizations, appraisal of danger during the war in Syria, and exposure to war experiences, as well as the coping resources of SOC and ComSOC. The results show that time spent in the camp, appraisal of danger, SOC, and ComSOC all play significant roles in predicting the variance of various mental-health outcomes. Together, those factors predict 56% of anxiety, 53% of depression, and 58% of somatization. SOC was also found to mediate the relationships between time spent in the camp and outcome variables, as well as the relationships between the appraisal of danger and the outcome variables. This indicates that SOC is crucial for good adaptation. These results will be discussed in light of the salutogenic theory.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Although there is ample empirical evidence that traumatic events, postmigration stress, and acculturation problems have a great impact on the mental health of refugees, so far no studies have included cultural identity after migration in the equation. This mixed-methods study conducted among Afghan and Iraqi refugee and asylum-seeker psychiatric patients aims to fill this gap. Associations between postmigration stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were significant. When differentiated for the two groups, associations with postmigration stress were no longer significant for Afghan patients, who were predominantly younger and more often single, lower educated, and without resident status compared with Iraqi patients. Qualitative results indicate that, in addition to psychopathology and postmigration stress, acculturation problems contribute to confusion of cultural identity. The findings suggest that reduction of postmigration stress and acculturation problems may clarify cultural identity and as such may contribute to posttraumatic recovery.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Objective: In 2017 the number of refugees around the world reached 25.4 million. These people make up one of the most vulnerable populations globally. This study aims to understand the strategies refugees used to cope with the impact on their mental health by the difficult pre-and post-resettlement circumstances they encountered. Method(s): A systematic review of articles reporting case studies concerning adult refugees' experiences in the hosting country. The electronic databases searched were: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligible manuscripts were examined through a narrative synthesis. Result(s): Twenty-two articles fitted the inclusion criteria and four main themes were highlighted: reasons for fleeing; the impact of negative experiences on mental health; supportive experiences and coping strategies; and experiences of mental health treatment. Conclusion(s): Refugees present a significant impact on mental health due to pre-and post-migration experiences. The approach offered to this group and reported as the most effective to deal with such an impact was the multidimensional approach that, besides caring for the psychic aspects, contemplated the cultural context of each one, assisted in housing, employment, financial aid, support with learning the new language and social activities.Copyright © 2019, Editora Cientifica Nacional Ltda.

Having knowledge about inequalities in health transitions over the life course between migrants and non-migrants, including at older ages, is crucial for the tailoring of policies to the demands of an ageing and culturally diverse society. We analyse differences in health transitions between migrants and non-migrants, specifically focusing on the older population in Europe. Method(s): We used longitudinal data on migrants and non-migrants aged 50 and older in 10 southern and western European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2004-2015). We applied multinomial logistic regression models of experiencing health deterioration among individuals in good health at baseline, and of experiencing health improvement among individuals in poor health at baseline, separately by sex, in which migrant status (non-migrant, western migrant, non-western migrant) was the main explanatory variable. We considered three dimensions of health, namely self-rated health, depression and diabetes. Result(s): At older ages, migrants in Europe were at higher risk than non-migrants of experiencing a deterioration in health relative to remaining in a given state of self-rated health. Western migrants had a higher risk than non-migrants of becoming depressed, while non-western migrants had a higher risk of acquiring diabetes. Among females only, migrants also tended to be at lower risk than non-migrants of experiencing an improvement in both overall and mental health. Differences in the health transition patterns of older migrants and non-migrants remained robust to the inclusion of several covariates, including education, job status and health-related behaviours. Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that, in addition to having a health disadvantage at baseline, older migrants in Europe were more likely than older non-migrants to have experienced a deterioration in health over the study period. These results raise concerns about whether migrants in Europe are as likely as non-migrants to age in good health. We recommend that policies aiming to promote healthy ageing specifically address the health needs of the migrant population, thereby distinguishing migrants from different backgrounds.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose Perinatal depression is a significant contributor to maternal morbidity. Migrant women in resource-poor settings may be at increased risk, yet little research has been conducted in low-income and middle-income settings. This prospective cohort study of migrant women on the Thai-Myanmar border aims to establish prevalence of perinatal depression, identify risk factors for perinatal depression and examine associations with infant outcomes. Participants Participating women are labour migrants and refugees living on the Thai-Myanmar border. A total of 568 women were recruited in their first trimester of pregnancy and are being followed up to 1-year postpartum. Findings to date At baseline, women in our study had a median age of 25 years, the predominant ethnicity was Sgaw Karen (48.9%), agriculture was the main employment sector (39.2%) and educational attainment was low with a median of 4 years of education. In the first trimester of pregnancy, a quarter (25.8%; 95% CI 22.3 to 29.5) of all women were depressed as diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of DSM-IV Disorders. Future plans Follow-up is ongoing and expected to continue until January 2018. The prevalence of depression at later stages of pregnancy and during the first postpartum year will be identified, and associations between depression status and demographic, social, migration-related, medical, obstetric and infant factors will be quantified.

N2  - Background: Refugees and war survivors are at higher risk of developing mental health disorders. Anxiety and stress are caused by many factors, including a stressful environment that could cause fatigue and low quality of life. Despite the existence of many synthetic anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs, symptom management has still not been successful. Ginkgo biloba extract has been used as one of the potential herbal remedies to enhance cognitive functions. Psycho-education plays a significant role in alleviating psychological distress. However, the role of G. biloba in alleviating anxiety, stress and fatigue among refugees was not well studied previously. Objective(s): In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of G. biloba and psycho-education with only psycho-education on refugees' anxiety, stress and fatigue. Method(s): A randomized controlled, pre-test-post-test design was used. Data were measured at baseline and 6 weeks later. Result(s): Providing psycho-education for the control group showed a non-significant improvement in outcome variables. However, adding G. biloba to psycho-education for the experimental group showed a significant reduction in mental, physical, activity fatigue and anxiety. Conclusion(s): The addition of G. biloba to the psycho-education proved superior to psycho-education alone. Therefore, combining the two approaches is beneficial in alleviating anxiety and fatigue.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - Women and men have different life conditions, they are exposed to different traumata and experiences of trust. Trust depends upon refugee women's sense of security publicly and at home and data demonstrates that public interest in sexual harassment and abuse is associated to women's general level of anxiety and sense of victimhood. There is increasing attention paid to providing comprehensive care to refugee women recognising that many are subjected to other severe forms of abuse frequently of a sexual nature. Further, they frequently come from societies where women's role is primarily centred round the home. Such women may need particular attention when having to cope with the refugee situation in order to avoid that their particular needs are neglected in the host country when it comes to integration initiatives. Many migrant women may feel dis-empowered when coming to a new environment, and therapeutic interventions should have empowerment as a goal helping such women to develop skills to gain control over their life without infringing on others rights. To achieve this we have to listen and support the proposals to solutions these women bring forward even if they do not coincide with our own ideas, discuss their solutions and try to understand their cognitive and emotional world view by building a bridge over cultural incongruence. But also to support any initiative that may diminish women's confidence in being protected against violence and abuse at home. This is a major public health issue presently and a challenge to psychiatry.

N2  - The debates on the mental health benefits associated with immigration are mixed. On the one hand, immigrants are provided with more opportunities not available in their home countries. On the other hand, they are far away from home and may have been exposed to traumatic experiences on their journeys to the receiving country. Even after settling down in the receiving country, most continue to face legal battles associated with their immigration status, as shown in this study. This study examined the risk and protective factors associated with the mental health conditions in a sample of 39 immigrants and refugees seeking legal services on the US-Mexico border. Participants were recruited from a southwestern community agency serving the region's immigrant population over the past three decades. Negative mental health states including stress, sadness, and anxiety were frequently reported by the participants. Six themes were identified as significantly related to the participants' adjustment in the US: (1) political turmoil and safety issues; (2) economic hardship and extreme poverty; (3) trauma before and after resettlement; (4) immigration status; (5) family relational strain; and (6) identity struggle and acculturation. Overall, results demonstrate the complexity of issues pertaining to cross-country migration, cultural sensitivities, and mental health.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - The study focuses on psychosocial functioning of female Turkish immigrants in Austria with recurrent depressive disorder participating in self-help groups. Self-help groups guided by group leaders of Turkish descent should increase autonomy in participants, providing the opportunity to follow their ethnic health beliefs. Turkish immigrant women (n = 43) with recurrent depressive disorder participated in self-help groups over four months. Qualitative data of participants and group leaders, containing interviews, group protocols and supervision protocols of group leaders were analyzed using the qualitative content analysis for effects on psychosocial function, such as interaction with others, illness beliefs and benefit from self-help group. Women reported feelings of being neglected and violated by their husbands. They stated that they had gained strength and had emancipated themselves from their husbands. Self-help groups functioned as social resources and support for changes in participants' lives. Further interventions should integrate the functional value of depressive symptoms and focus on social support systems and social networks.Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Research Objectives: To investigate changes in depression, anxiety and quality of life (QOL) in a Hispanic, primarily immigrant and monolingual Spanish-speaking population at one-year post-surgery for intractable epilepsy.DesignRetrospective study. Individuals' pre-surgical depression, anxiety and QOL scores were compared with their one-year post-surgical scores. Established classifications of depression and anxiety severity (i.e., minimal, mild, moderate or severe) were used to analyze incidence of clinical depression and anxiety at one-year post-surgery. Setting(s): A comprehensive epilepsy treatment center in an urban, public health setting in Los Angeles, California. Participant(s): Adult, Hispanic, primarily immigrant, Spanish-speaking patients (n=47) undergoing surgery for intractable epilepsy between 2008 and 2014, and who completed pre-surgical and one-year post-surgical neuropsychological evaluation were included. Intervention(s): Resective surgery for intractable epilepsy.Main Outcome Measure(s)Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31). Result(s): Paired sample t-tests revealed significant improvements at or beyond, the p <.05 level, on BDI-II, BAI and all QOLIE-31 subscale scores one-year post-surgery, when compared to pre-surgery. McNemar chi-square analyses revealed that the incidence of clinical depression (p =.006) and anxiety (p =.007) was significantly less frequent at 1-year post-surgery. Improvements were robust and unaffected by gender, education, or surgical hemisphere. Effect sizes were medium to large on the BDI-II and majority QOLIE-31 subscales, with small effects on the BAI and remaining QOLIE-31 subscales.Conclusion/DiscussionThis study documents the benefits of epilepsy surgery on depression, anxiety and QOL in a Hispanic, primarily immigrant, Spanish-speaking population of people with epilepsy (PWE) in the southwestern US. These results are useful for educating this unique and under-served population about the possible benefits of surgery for intractable epilepsy and can enhance pre-surgical counseling.

N2  - Introduction: Psychosocial factors have a major role in coronary heart disease (CHD). In particular, individuals with anxiety, depression and low social support are at increased risk of first occurrence, recurrence and mortality of CHD events. Yet, psychosocial factors are seldom assessed systematically in cardiovascular primary prevention programs. Objective(s): To evaluate prevalence and features associated with psychosocial heart-threatening factors among participants to ProSALUTE, an experimental Cardiovascular Health Program carried out in a lowincome and multiethnic community from a peripheral neighborhood of Milan, Italy Methods: ProSALUTE involves residents of both genders aged 40 to 65. This study refers to the first 260 subjects (57% females) that adhered to the Program (among 1300 contacts). Prevalence of immigrants was similar in the sample (34%) and in the population (38%), suggesting fair inclusion. Psychosocial variables were assessed using the following questionnaires:PHQ4 for anxiety and depression and FSSQ for social support. Considering multi-ethnicity, tools were administered in 5 different languages. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess associations between psychosocial variables and demographic and lifestyle characteristics. Result(s): Scores for anxiety, depression and social support were above the standard cutoff in 27%, 16% and 20% of the sample, respectively. In univariate analyses, anxiety negatively correlated with education (r=- 0.5; p < 0.05), depression negatively correlated with education (r=-0.4; p < 0.005) and positively with smoking habit (r=0.6; p < 0.05) and immigrant status (r=0.4; p=0.06) whereas low social support positively correlated with immigrant status (r=-0.3; p< 0.005, respectively) Conclusion(s): At least 1 heart-threatening psychosocial condition affects 63% of participants in ProSALUTE. Education level and immigrant status seem to be the most influent determinants of adverse psychosocial factors, suggesting the need of personalized preventative interventions for these conditions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Refugees are at risk of psychiatric morbidity because of forced migration, traumatic events and resettlement in unfamiliar environments. Many live in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC) under stressful conditions contributing to increased suicide risk., AIMS: This study assessed the feasibility of regular contact and use of safety planning cards (CASP) by community volunteers (CVs) in reducing suicidal behaviour among Sri Lankan refugees residing in camps in Tamil Nadu, South India., METHODS: A household survey was carried out on consenting adults in two refugee camps - one intervention and one control - randomly selected using lottery method. The primary outcome was reduction in suicidal behaviour. Experience of trauma during war and migration, depression, post-traumatic stress and alcohol use were documented. Individuals scoring >16 on Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) or >30 on Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or with active/passive suicidal ideation or a history of previous suicidal attempts were considered as high risk. CVs were trained to deliver CASP intervention to high-risk individuals. Change from baseline to follow-up was computed for intervention and control groups, and the difference between changes in suicide rates was compared using proportion test., RESULTS: In total, 639 refugees from intervention and 664 from control camps participated. Of the 288 high-risk refugees in intervention camp, 139 completed the intervention. In the control camp, 187 were categorised as high risk. Prevalence of suicide attempts was 6.1%. Following intervention, differences between sites in changes in combined suicide (attempted suicides and suicides) rates per 100,000 per year were 519 (95% confidence interval (CI): 136-902; p<.01)., CONCLUSION: CASP, an intervention involving contact by CVs and use of safety planning cards, is feasible to implement and can reduce suicidal behaviour among refugees. Its replication in more settings will enhance validity.

N2  - The morbidity and mortality of Latino immigrants in the United States (US) stem from a complex mix of policy, culture, discrimination and economics. Immigrants working as day labourers may be particularly vulnerable to the negative influences of these social factors due to limited access to social, financial and legal resources. We aimed to understand how the health of male Latino day labourers in North Carolina, US is influenced by their experiences interacting with their community and perceptions of their social environment. To respond to our research questions, we conducted three focus groups (n = 9, n = 10, n = 10) and a photovoice project (n = 5) with Latino male immigrants between October 2013 and March 2014. We conducted a thematic analysis of transcripts from the discussions in the focus groups and the group discussions with Photovoice participants. We found that men's health and well-being were primarily shaped by their experiences and feelings of discrimination and marginalisation. We identified three main links between discrimination/marginalisation and poor health: (i) dangerous work resulted in workplace injuries or illnesses; (ii) unsteady employment caused stress, anxiety and insufficient funds for healthcare; and (iii) exclusionary policies and treatment resulted in limited healthcare accessibility. Health promotion with Latino immigrant men in new settlement areas could benefit from community-building activities, addressing discrimination, augmenting the reach of formal healthcare and building upon the informal mechanisms that immigrants rely on to meet their health needs. Reforms to immigration and labour policies are also essential to addressing these structural barriers to health for these men.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify the medical and mental health needs of unaccompanied, undocumented adolescent immigrants in New York City, and to formulate program and policy initiatives to address these needs. While by no means a novel phenomenon, unaccompanied immigration to the United States has increased dramatically in recent years, doubling yearly from 2011 to 2013, then increasing more than three-fold in 2014, when approximately 68,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended crossing the southwestern US border. More than three quarters of these youth were between 14 and 18 years old, indicating that this recent "surge" demands the particular attention of the adolescent health community. Method(s): This study consisted of in-depth, individual interviews with 14 professionals who spend at least 50% of their time working with unaccompanied, undocumented youth in New York City. The categories of professionals recruited and interviewed-lawyers, medical and mental health providers, social workers, teachers and community advocatesd were chosen to represent the professions with whom unaccompanied adolescents have the most interaction. Four of the 14 were themselves formerly undocumented youth. Domains addressed in semi-structured interviews included: participants' perceptions of medical and mental health needs among unaccompanied immigrant youth; their experiences interacting with other professionals and implementing programs to address these needs; and identifying strengths and assets of unaccompanied immigrant youth. All interviews were audio recorded, then transcribed and coded by a single analyst using thematic analysis. Result(s): Key themes were: 1) mental health issues and symptoms; 2) medical concerns and associated barriers to care; 3) strengths and assets; and 4) successful interventions. Mental health concerns included trauma experienced before, during and after migration (mentioned by every participant); depression (mentioned by 7 participants); and anxiety (mentioned by 5 participants), as well as nightmares, panic disorders, inability to focus and stress. Trauma was discussed in depth, with significant distinctions drawn between complex trauma and post-traumatic stress. Medical concerns included occupational health risks, the need for preventive health care and barriers to care for undocumented adolescents. In terms of strengths and assets, all participants spoke to the resilience of unaccompanied immigrant youth and identified specific manifestations of this characteristic. Finally, participants spoke about interventions that have been successful in addressing some of the mental and medical health needs of unaccompanied, undocumented adolescents. Conclusion(s): This study presents a nuanced picture of the needs and assets of unaccompanied adolescent immigrants in New York City based on in-depth interviews with key professionals working directly with this population. Utilizing a strengths-based perspective, the study also proposes innovative programming and policies to address these needs. The study's concluding recommendations include promoting integration of services, concerted outreach efforts and social, cultural and recreational programming to meet the needs of unaccompanied adolescent immigrants. While this study focuses specifically on unaccompanied adolescents in New York City, it reveals a complex set of needs and innovative approaches that may translate to other communities where unaccompanied adolescent immigrants live across the United States.

N2  - Introduction: When mother's mental health is compromised, children are at greater risk for poor behavioral (Goodman et al., 2011), cognitive (Petterson & Albers, 2001) and health (Zeller et al., 2007) outcomes. Despite these established links for European Americans, fewer studies have examined parental mental health and child outcomes in Hispanic immigrants. Importantly, some key risks may operate differently for Hispanic-immigrant families (Badanes et al. 2014). Thus, issues of measurement variance are important to address to accurately identify families for services. Participant(s): Participants were 123 parents (98% mothers) with a child (5-46 months) in Early Head Start. Parents were 36% (n=44) non-Hispanic, 18% (n=22) Hispanic, and 46% (n=57) Hispanic immigrant. Over 86% of families were living in poverty (<=200% FPL). Method(s): To decrease literacy and cultural barriers, all data were collected via caregiver interview by a bicultural and bilingual research team. Adverse child experiences were calculated via the ACE calculator (Feletti et al. 1991). Parent depression was assessed via the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (Radlooff, 1977), anxiety via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (Spitzer et al. 2006), and parenting stress by the Parenting Stress Index (Abidin 1983). Results were compared for non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and Hispanic-immigrants. Result(s): For all parents, income and education were unrelated to current depression, anxiety, or parenting stress. Non-Hispanics' ACE and economic hardship, respectively, related to parent depression (r=.58, p<.001; r=.53, p<.001), anxiety (r=.52, p<.001; r=.57, p<.001) and parenting stress (r=.42; p<.01; r=.45, p<.01). For Hispanics, ACE related to depression (r=.43, p<.05) and anxiety (r=.70, p<.001), but not parenting stress. For Hispanic-immigrants, ACE and economic hardship only related to anxiety (r=.29, p<.05; r=.37, p<.01). Discussion(s): Results show that risks differ for non-Hispanic and Hispanic parents. This may indicate important measurement variance or mean that different risks predict poor outcomes for different groups. Understanding how to measure risk for Hispanic immigrant families is crucial considering the U.S.'s rapidly changing population. Accurately determining risks may help physicians, clinicians, and researchers to determine appropriate families to refer to intervention.

N2  - PURPOSE: To explore Somali immigrant new mothers' experience of childbirth in Minnesota., DESIGN: The ethnonursing research method was used. Semistructured interviews with 12 immigrant Somali mothers in a Midwestern metropolitan area were conducted. Analysis of the data followed Leininger and McFarland's four-phase ethnonursing data analysis guide., RESULTS: Six themes were identified in relation to Somali immigrant new mothers' experience of childbirth in the United States: the limitations of support due to separation from family, the importance of cultural and religious beliefs and practices, the desired relationships with nurses, the fear of Cesarean section, the value of education, and views on postpartum blues/depression., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses should develop trusting relationships with Somali mothers and facilitate cultural and religious practices. Information regarding support resources in the community should be provided to Somali mothers.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Cultural Influence on Coping Strategies of Filipino Immigrant Nurses
AU  - Connor, Jorgia B.

N2  - Much of the research on internationally educated nurses (IENs) has focused on the challenges they encounter in the United States and how they can best be integrated into the workplace. Despite their many challenges, Filipino IENs continue to come to the United States and thrive, bringing with them diverse experience and knowledge that contribute to the provision of quality care to a patient population that is becoming increasingly diverse. Although a substantial body of research has been published on IEN coping, fewer studies have focused on the influence of culture on Filipino IEN's preferred coping strategies. This study contributes to the burgeoning interest in understanding culture's influence on coping patterns and preferences among diverse populations. Occupational health nurses and administrators can use these findings to develop culturally appropriate health promotion programs and interventions to retain quality nurses and promote healthier workplaces.

N2  - Responding to the concern about underutilization of mental health services in immigrant populations, the present study explored the factors associated with Korean immigrants' willingness to use mental health services. Guided by Andersen's behavioral model, consideration was given to the role of predisposing (age, gender, marital status, education, and years in the United States), need (depressive symptoms), and enabling (health insurance, acculturation, and personal beliefs about depression) variables. The study estimated, using data from a sample of 205 Korean immigrants (ages 18-45), a logistic regression model of willingness to use mental health services. Although participants experiencing more depressive symptoms tend to be less willing to use these services (odds ratio [OR] = .89, p < .05), an increase in the odds of willingness to use them are found among women (OR = 2.52, p < .01), highly acculturated individuals (OR = 1.09, p < .05), and individuals who believe that depression is a medical condition (OR = 4.71, p < .01). Educational interventions focused on increasing mental health literacy may be beneficial in promoting mental health services for Korean immigrants.

N2  - Background: To examine levels of psychological distress and help seeking behaviour in resettled refugees attending English tuition classes in Australia, and their associations with participants' demographic characteristics. Method(s): Data was collected by bilingual interviewers between March and November 2013. A volunteer sample of attendees of Adult Migrant English Programs (AMEP) in Western Sydney were recruited. Participants were two hundred and twenty five Iraqi refugees resettled in Western Sydney, who had left Iraq no earlier than 1991, were fluent in Arabic and/or English, and were between the ages of 18 and 70. The chief outcome measures used were the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10) as well as The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Result(s): On the K-10, 39.8% of participants had severe psychological distress, 19.4% moderate distress, and 40.7% had low to mild distress. Ninety-five percent of participants reported having experienced one or more potentially traumatic event (PTE) as defined by the HTQ prior to leaving Iraq, with a mean of 14.28 events (SD = 8.69). Thirty-one percent of participants met the threshold (>=2.5) for clinically significant PTSD symptomatology, with a significantly higher occurrence among participants with lower education attainment (chi2 (3) = 8.26, p =04). Of those participants with clinically significant PTSD symptomatology according to the HTQ, only 32.9% reported ever having ever sought help for a mental health problem. Conclusion(s): The high level of distress found in this sample, combined with low uptake of mental health care, highlights the need for programs targeted to promote help-seeking among Iraqi refugees who have resettled in Australia. Further, the higher level of PTSD symptomatology found amongst those with lower education attainment has mental health promotion and treatment implications. Specifically, in designing service and treatment programs, consideration should be given to the possible impact excessive levels of psychological distress may have on learning in refugees, to ensure that those who have been unable to develop proficiency in the English language receive effective care.Copyright © Slewa-Younan et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

N2  - Introduction: Research on health care provided to clients with limited English proficiency in the United States has revealed poor satisfaction and increased use of the health care system. This mixed-methods study explored health literacy and the perinatal experiences of Somali and Somali Bantu women living in Lewiston, Maine. The study also describes the development and validation of historietas (comic-book style health education brochure) used to increase knowledge and awareness of why emergency cesareans may be required and the symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD). Method(s): During phase 1, a focus group to discuss the perinatal experiences of Somali women (n = 4) was undertaken and 2 historietas were developed to create greater understanding of emergency cesareans and PPD. In phase 2, Somali and Somali Bantu women (n = 19) completed a health literacy questionnaire and a perinatal experiences questionnaire. A focus group was also conducted during phase 2 to determine the perinatal experiences of the participants. Phase 2 participants validated the historietas developed in phase 1. Responses from focus groups were triangulated with data from the perinatal experiences questionnaire completed during phase 2. Result(s): Overall, none of the phase 2 participants demonstrated adequate health literacy. Problems with gudnin (Somali word for cutting) related to female genital mutilation/cutting and PPD yielded statistically significant results. Somali women expressed dissatisfaction with certain obstetric interventions, especially emergency cesareans. Phase 2 participants unanimously validated the usefulness of the historietas as a clinical teaching tool. Discussion(s): Poor health literacy due to language barriers may place Somali women living in the United States at risk for adverse outcomes during pregnancy and/or birth. Complications related to emergency cesareans and PPD were identified as significant problems for which Somali women require further knowledge. Historietas addressing knowledge gaps related to emergency cesareans and symptoms of PPD were validated by participants as useful teaching tools.Copyright © 2015 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

N2  - Cambodians living in the U.S.A. suffer from depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic medical disease at rates far in excess of national averages. The Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma's Cambodian Health Promotion Program seeks to address this burden of disease by offering them culturally tailored health education in a group setting. A health professional and a bicultural health educator co-facilitated a five-session health promotion group for Cambodian survivors of torture from 2007 to 2011. The program covered five major topics from Western and Cambodian worldviews. They included the meaning of health promotion, nutrition, exercise, stress management and sleep hygiene, and health practitioner-patient communication. The bicultural worker administered Pre and Post semi-structured Health Promotion Questionnaires. The data presented here are the results from 126 participants. Changes between the Pre and Post health promotion groups demonstrated significant improvements in health status, lifestyle activities, sleep, and depression. Participants revealed greater confidence in communicating with their primary health care practitioner. Culturally tailored Cambodian health promotion education administered in a small group setting may improve health and mental health behaviors. Culturally tailored health promotion education in a small group setting may promote healing in survivors of torture. It is an intervention worthy of further research and development.

N2  - Introduction Non-Western cleaners have been shown to have poorer health than their Danish colleagues. One reason could be a poorer psychosocial work environment. However, it is unknown if differences in self-reported psychosocial work environment exist between non-Western and Danish workers within the same social class. The aim of this study was to investigate such differences among cleaners with the hypothesis that the non-Western compared with Danish cleaners would report a generally poorer psychosocial work environment. Methods Two hundred and eighty-five cleaners (148 Danes and 137 non-Western immigrants) from 9 workplaces in Denmark participated in this cross-sectional study. The cleaners' immigrant status was tested for association with psychosocial work environment scales from the short version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) using ordinal logistic regression. Results Models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking, workplace, and perceived physical work exertion showed that non-Western cleaners compared with Danish cleaners reported significantly higher scores with regard to Predictability (OR = 3.97), Recognition (OR = 1.92), Quality of Leadership (OR = 1.81), Trust Regarding Management (OR = 1.72), and Justice (OR = 2.14). Conclusions This study showed that non-Western immigrant cleaners reported a statistically significantly better psychosocial work environment than Danish cleaners on a number of scales. Therefore, the hypothesis of non-Western immigrants reporting worse psychosocial work environment than their Danish colleagues was not supported. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

N2  - 20 million migrant workers in China lost their jobs during the economic crisis of 2008. Both urban migration and unemployment have long been documented to be associated with vulnerability to mental problems. This study aims to examine the mental health of unemployed migrant workers in Eastern China and its relation to duration of unemployment and coping strategy during the recent economic crisis. The data were collected through interview-based survey with a sample of 210 unemployed migrant workers in Zhejiang Province of China from 2008 to 2009. Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, and seven short demographic questions were used. The majority of the unemployed migrant workers were found to be young male manufacturing industry workers with short-term unemployment and a relatively low education level. Nearly 50% of unemployed migrant workers were classified as mentally unhealthy and the most frequently reported symptom was depression. Compared with the adult norm of 1986, 2003, and 2007 in China, unemployed migrants had more mental problems. Long-term unemployed migrant workers had more psychiatric symptoms than the short-term unemployed workers and employed migrant workers. Unemployed migrant workers with immature coping strategies expressed significantly more psychiatric symptoms than those with mixed and mature coping strategies. Duration of unemployment and two coping strategies, problem-solving and self-blaming, predicted the mental problems of unemployed migrant workers. The results indicated that mental health status of unemployed migrant workers in Eastern China was poorer than the national adult norm. More psychiatric symptoms are evidenced among unemployed migrant workers who lost their jobs for a long term and who had immature coping strategies. These findings can be used for prevention and intervention of mental illness among unemployed migrant workers.

N2  - Educational objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation, the participants should be able to recognize WHO Health Promotion principles to closing the implementation gap by developing a holistic and gender strategy for collaboration regarding amental health promotion course in the reception of refugees with mental illness and disability. Background(s): Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. Health literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals can obtain, process and understand the basic health information and services they need to make appropriate health decisions. Refugees' mental health and social integration are closely connected. Immigration patterns have changed over time but problems with discrimination and human rights issues persist. Traumatic experiences and posttraumatic stress increase the risk of having lower health literacy compared with the host population. Independent of country/area of origin, female refugees seem to be a group at risk of mental ill health among immigrant women in Sweden whereas male refugees have similar risk pattern as non-refugee immigrants. As a consequence, refugee women are at higher risk compared to men for failure in the reception program and social integration. Purpose(s): We will present an evaluation of a tailor-made intervention- a Mental Health Promotion Course developed at Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma, USA-for refugees as course-students in the introduction programme in Sodertalje municipality, a southern suburb of Stockholm. It started as a project funded by Stockholm County Council, Public Health budget, in the autumn 2008 and it will continue during 2011. Method(s): A prospective, longitudinal design is used, with pre- and post-evaluation, including EQ-5D questionnaire (Arabic version) with high validity and reliability. The course lasts 5 weeks; 2 h a week, with lectures and dialogue, and ends with a diploma to each participant. The curriculum includes introduction, access to health service, exercise, stress and prevention; and communication and encounter with a primary health doctor. The class is coordinated by the nurse, with an interpreter in the room and consists of up to about ten participants, both men and women, mainly from Iraq. The clinicians (nurse, physiotherapist, psychologist and primary health doctor) is in charge of each week's curriculum. The coordinator repeats the policy with the participants each week and the course ends weekly with a relaxation exercise. Result(s): The content of the curriculum seems to be relevant for the participants, many of whom are vulnerable to post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression and disability. After 5 weeks, several of the participants, especially women want to continue. Conclusion(s): Challenges and possibilities of lessons learnt are shared among the group participants, 'being in the same boat'. The structure and clinical professionals promote trust.

PY  - 2011
PD  - /
N2  - Background/Objectives: The Romanian emigration to the European Union job market increased in the post-communist years. Research all over the world revealed that immigrant groups show high rates of mental disorders. This paper describes the therapeutic intervention in the case of a 47-year-old woman who has been an emigrant for 4 years. During this time she has worked as a housekeeper and caretaker for an old man with Alzheimer's disease. The client, R., was a talented woman from the hypnotic responsiveness viewpoint, and she resorted to psychotherapy three years after returning from Italy. Six month after returning home, she was diagnosed with late-onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with depression and panic attacks. The therapy was initially aimed at eliminating the symptoms of panic disorder, as well as those of depression and PTSD. Method(s): The case was approached through cognitive-behavioural therapy combined with techniques of hypnosis and self-hypnosis for 25 sessions delivered in a one session per week format. Follow-up sessions took place at intervals of one, three and 12 months. Hypnosis included anxiety management, relaxation, ego strengthening with a view to help the client feel better about herself and improve social interaction, as well as to eliminate the symptoms of "negative self-hypnosis". The treatment also included cognitive restructuring, prolonged exposure to traumatic memories, guided dialogue with one's own self and distraction techniques. Assessment of intervention results was carried out both subjectively and objectively, by pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. Symptom changes were monitored throughout the course of therapy in a multiple-baseline study design. Result(s): The results indicate that the therapeutic interventions removed the symptoms specific to the comorbid disorders diagnosed and improved the mental health status. Discussion/Conclusions: Hypnosis may be a particularly appropriate adjunct to cognitive-behavioural therapy for a "virtuoso" client. This single case study illustrates that emigration may be a risk factor for mental health especially when it involves stressful working conditions interacting with a state of psychological vulnerability.

TI  - Psycho-educational and spiritual interventions for low income cancer patients: Results of a randomized versus patient preference trial
AU  - Moadel, A. 
PY  - 2011
PD  - /
N2  - PURPOSE: Despite evidence that psychosocial interventions offer benefits to quality of life (QoL) after cancer, effects are modest, and at times, inconsistent. Reasons for this may be due to small sample sizes, low enrollment rates, and poor intervention adherence plaguing the field of psychosocial oncology research. Enrollment and adherence are lowest among underserved populations and ethnic minority cancer survivors who may face socioeconomic and cultural barriers to participation. Research on preferences, needs and practices regarding psychosocial interventions among cancer patients clearly indicates that it is not "one- size-fits-all". The Mind-Body Cancer Research Program was developed to meet the documented psychosocial and spiritual needs of the ethnic minority and underserved cancer patient with advanced disease and those on active treatment by comparing two different interventions, a spiritual support group and the standard-of-care psycho-educational group, and two different methodologies, randomized assignment versus patient preference. METHOD(S): The study design was implemented in two steps: 1) the development of a spiritual-existential group and a psycho- educational group, and 2) the assessment of two methodologies on enrollment, retention and outcome of the group interventions: a) a randomized comparison trial, and b) a patient preference trial, whereby patients could participate in their group of choice. The Mind-Body Cancer Research Program was implemented between 2004-2010 within a major cancer center in the underserved community of Bronx, New York. RESULT(S): The sample (n = 114) was predominantly female, African- American or Hispanic, U.S. immigrants, and high school educated. Retention was modest with only 54% completing a pre- and post-intervention assessment, and as many as 23% not attending the intervention. Those who chose not to enroll in the intervention study were more likely to be male (29% vs. 19%), less likely to be self-referred (6% vs. 18%) or doctor-referred (21% vs. 37%), less likely to be African American (30% vs. 50%) and more likely to be Hispanic (38% vs. 24%), (ps < 0.05). Those who enrolled in the Preference trial reported lower religiosity and social support and higher use of active coping than those in the Randomized trial. In the Preference trial, there were 69% of patients who chose the Stress Management group versus only 31% who chose the Spiritual Support Group. Reasons for choosing Stress Management centered on wanting to learn how to manage stress/difficult emotions (60%), and/or feeling spiritually supported already (15%). Reasons for choosing Spiritual Support were based on wanting to enhance or reinforce their spiritual practices/beliefs (50%) and/or address existential concerns such as the need to maintain hope, peace, sanity, and cope with death (20%). Those choosing the Spiritual Support Group endorsed having higher education, more private religious activity, better quality of life, lower anxiety, and greater use of humor as a coping strategy. Adherence to and positive evaluation of the program were highest among the Preference arm. CONCLUSION(S): This research presents a glimpse into the challenges and successes related to implementing a psychosocial intervention study with underserved, active treatment cancer patients, as well as the importance of enhancing enrollment, participation and outcome among these populations in psychosocial research. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: It is important to identify culturally-competent research methods to help enhance access and interest in behavioral research for underserved cancer patient populations. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is not always one-size-fits-all when it comes to psychosocial care, and allowing patients a choice of intervention may not only improve adherence but outcome as well.

N2  - Not all traumatic events cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and people develop PTSD symptoms after events that do not seem to be overwhelmingly traumatic. In order to direct services appropriately, there is a need to distinguish time-limited. post-traumatic symptoms and acute stress reactions (that may improve spontaneously without treatment or respond to discrete interventions) from PTSD, with its potentially more chronic pathway and possible long-term effects on the personality. In this article, we describe acute and chronic stress disorders and evidence about the most effective treatments.

N2  - The primary objectives of this study were: (i) to evaluate the capacity of a well-validated anxiety prevention and emotional resiliency program (FRIENDS) to reduce psychological distress in young culturally diverse migrants of non-English speaking background (NESB), and (ii) to determine whether any change in psychological symptoms and emotional resilience would be maintained over time. Three hundred and twenty-four students differentiated by cultural origin (former-Yugoslavian, Chinese, and mixed-ethnic) and educational level (elementary and high school), were recruited from different Australian states and allocated to either an intervention or wait-list condition. All students completed standardized measures of self-esteem, internalizing symptoms, and future outlook both before and after a 10-week FRIENDS intervention or wait period. One hundred and thirty-nine participants from Queensland were also assessed six months following completion of the FRIENDS program to determine its long-term effects. Consistent with previous trials involving culturally diverse populations, NESB participants who underwent FRIENDS training exhibited significantly greater self-esteem, fewer internalizing symptoms, and a less pessimistic future outlook than wait-list participants at both post- and six months follow-up assessment intervals. This study provides empirical evidence for the utility of the FRIENDS program as a resource for therapists and schools working with young culturally diverse migrant populations.

N2  - During the 24-year Indonesian occupation of East Timor, widespread human rights abuses led to the flight of political dissidents to neighboring countries. We report a pilot study assessing a 'Researcher-Advocacy' model among East Timorese asylum seekers residing in Australia. The aim was to combine elements of advocacy, quantitative and qualitative research, and strategic assistance in a program of engagement with this marginalized group. Thirty-three consecutive asylum-seeker clients attending a newly formed clinic participated in the study, representing a quarter of the known population of asylum seekers from East Timor living in Sydney at the time. High levels of trauma including torture and other human rights abuses were recorded. Respondents also reported a wide range of resettlement and adaptational difficulties, particularly relating to their uncertain residency status. Eighty percent met criteria for one or more psychiatric disorder. The wider benefits of the study included the extension of services to a group that previously had shown a reluctance to seek assistance for traumatic stress, the engagement of the exile community as a whole, and building the capacity to respond both in Australia and in East Timor to the humanitarian emergency of 1999. Scientific limitations of the model included the labor-intensive nature of the program, the small and selective sample recruited and incomplete data collection.

N2  - No previous studies have examined suicide risk among Central American immigrants. The present study explored the relationship between acculturative stress, depression, and suicidal ideation among Central American immigrants. Also examined were variables that predict depression and suicidal ideation. Elevated levels of acculturative stress were significantly correlated with high levels of depression and suicidal ideation. Family dysfunction, ineffective social support, nonpositive expectations concerning the future, low levels of religiosity, low levels of education and income, and lack of agreement with the decision to immigrate were significantly associated with high levels of depression and suicidal ideation. The overall findings suggest that Central American immigrants who experience elevated levels of acculturative stress may be at risk for experiencing heightened levels of depression and suicidal ideation. The findings highlight the importance of using culturally relevant clinical methods when assessing and treating depressed and potentially suicidal acculturating individuals.

N2  - Globally, conflicts continue to result in large numbers of refugees and displaced persons, the majority are women. At present, there is scant literature on the mental health status of refugee women following resettlement in countries that grant asylum. We do know that adaptation following migration is a complex cultural, psychological and social process. Some studies have suggested a high prevalence of depression symptoms related to premigration and post-migration experiences. The purpose of this paper will be to describe the mental health status of Southeast Asian (S.E.A.) refugee women in the United States, before home visit interventions by school nurses and bilingual teachers, and at 10, 20 and 33 weeks following the intervention. A comparison group of S.E.A. refugee women, who did not receive the intervention, were evaluated for mental health status on two occasions ten weeks apart. The identified needs and problems identified by the women, the interventions implemented by the school nurses and the success of the interventions will also be discussed. The underlying problem for the majority of women was poverty and social isolation. The study demonstrates that indeed, refugee women in the U.S., are experiencing needs and problems related to basic survival issues in multiple areas of their lives. The findings suggest that home visit interventions by nurses may be a valuable means of reducing depression in S.E.A. refugee women.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cumulative trauma exposures can have a profound effect on women's health and well-being. Black immigrant women are disproportionately affected by cumulative trauma experiences that place them at risk for multiple health issues such as reproductive sexual health problems and HIV, or mental health problems such as PTSD. The trauma-informed internet and mobile phone-based Being Safe, Healthy, and Positively Empowered (BSHAPE) intervention was designed to comprehensively assess for cumulative traumatic experiences, for current safety, and to address women's co-occurring healthcare needs through educational, psychoeducational, and mindfulness-based stress-reduction components., PURPOSE: This paper describes the development, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary evaluation of the computer and phone delivered BSHAPE intervention among adult Black immigrant women survivors of cumulative trauma., METHOD: Seventy women participated in the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary evaluation of BSHAPE, with outcomes assessed at post-intervention. The feasibility and acceptability outcomes assessed were enrollment, adherence, and perceptions of the intervention. Preliminary evaluation outcomes included perceived stress, stress management, trauma coping self-efficacy, mindfulness, mental health (MH), HIV/STI risk, general empowerment, and empowerment related to safety., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a BSHAPE intervention is feasible and acceptable. Overall, women reported satisfaction with BSHAPE and provided suggestions for improvement. Women showed significant reduction in perceptions of stress, improved stress-management, enhanced self-efficacy, reduced HIV/STI risk, and improved MH, overall empowerment, as well as empowerment related to safety. The findings of this study will be useful in further refining BSHAPE and testing it in a full-scale randomized controlled trial., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03664362. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The review aimed to synthesise recent evidence on health service use and health outcomes among international migrant workers, compared with non-migrant workers., METHODS: A search was carried out in MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL for studies published between Jan 1, 2010, and Feb 29, 2020. Included outcomes were: occupational health service use, fatal occupational injury, HIV, and depression. Two authors independently screened records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and judged quality of evidence. We meta-analysed estimates and conducted subgroup analyses by sex, geographical origin, geographical destination, and regularity of migration., RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included comprising >17 million participants in 16 countries. Most studies investigated regular migrant workers in high-income destination countries. Compared with non-migrant workers, migrant workers were less likely to use health services (relative risk 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.73, 4 studies, 3,804,131 participants, I2 100%, low quality of evidence). They more commonly had occupational injuries (1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.45, 7 studies, 17,100,626 participants, I2 96%, low quality of evidence). Relative risks differed by geographical origin and/or destination. There is uncertainty (very low quality of evidence) about occupational health service use (0 studies), fatal occupational injuries (5 studies, N = 14,210,820), HIV (3 studies, N = 13,775), and depression (2 studies, N = 7,512)., CONCLUSIONS: Migrant workers may be less likely than non-migrant workers to use health services and more likely to have occupational injuries. More research is required on migrant workers from and in low- and middle-income countries, across migration stages, migrating irregularly, and in the informal economy.

N2  - Based on the Reserve Capacity Model, this study investigated the associations of objective socioeconomic status and subjective social status with psychological health and the underlying psychosocial mechanisms in a population-based sample of Chinese migrants (n = 15,999). Results showed that subjective social status was positively associated with life satisfaction and self-rated health through the mediation of psychological distress and perceived stress. Whereas education showed a very weak association with life satisfaction, income was directly associated with life satisfaction only. The findings suggest that reducing psychosocial vulnerabilities may be a potential impetus to eliminate socioeconomic health disparities among Chinese migrants.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Refugees face circumstances where their health and well-being are compromised. In this qualitative study, the aim was to understand Syrian refugee women's needs for care and the predisposing and enabling factors to healthcare access and utilisation., METHODS: Out of 945 Syrian mothers who gave birth in our university hospital between 2014 and 2018, 195 were reached; out of which, 47 women were included. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted and were later analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Depression was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at the end of the interview., RESULTS: Social isolation and maternal depression, language barrier and challenges while navigating the healthcare system emerged as the main themes of the study. Low educational and occupational status of the women, poor social resources, limited Turkish proficiency and unfamiliarity with the host healthcare system were identified as the predisposing factors for poor healthcare services utilisation., CONCLUSION: Recommendations include bridging language gaps, improving the navigation of the healthcare system by visual support or in-person interpretation, and psychosocial support. Providing hospital-based language courses to mothers and social integration programs for families will improve the mothers' well-being and indirectly care of the child.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Female Mexican Immigrants (FMIs) experience high rates of depression compared with other populations. For this population, depression is often exacerbated by social isolation associated with the experience of immigration. Aim 1. To measure whether a culturally situated peer group intervention will reduce depression and stress associated with the experience of immigration. Aim 2. To test whether an intervention using a "women's funds of knowledge" approach results in improved resilience, knowledge and empowerment. Aim 3. To investigate whether a culturally situated peer group intervention using a women's funds of knowledge approach can give participants a sense and experience of social and physical connection ("emplacement") that is lost in the process of immigration., METHODS: This mixed-methods study will implement "Tertulias" ("conversational gatherings" in Spanish), a peer support group intervention designed to improve health outcomes for FMI participants in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We will document results of the intervention on our primary hypotheses of a decrease in depression, and increases in resilience and social support, as well as on our secondary hypotheses of decreased stress (including testing of hair cortisol as a biomarker for chronic stress), and an increase in social connectedness and positive assessment of knowledge and empowerment., DISCUSSION: This project will address mental health disparities in an underserved population that experiences high rates of social isolation. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate that health challenges that may appear too complex and too hard to address can be using a multi-level, holistic approach. Our use of hair samples to test for the 3-month average levels of systemic cortisol will contribute to the literature on an emerging biomarker for analyzing chronic stress., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on 2/3/20, Identifier # NCT04254198 .

N2  - BACKGROUND: Refugees and migrants face an increased risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adequate care can be insufficient due to language barriers, cultural differences, and knowledge deficits of health service providers. Therefore, professional associations requested that healthcare providers to be educated to provide culturally sensitive care. An evidence-based educational intervention in the form of a continuing interprofessional education (CIPE) for healthcare providers on the topic of PTSD in migrants and refugees was developed, pilot-implemented, and evaluated according to the first two levels of the Kirkpatrick evaluation model (reaction and learning)., METHODS: The development of a curriculum for the CIPE intervention was based on a narrative literature review. Its content was validated by experts (N = 17) in an online survey and analyzed using both the Content Validity Index and a thematic analysis. The evaluation of the CIPE intervention was performed by conducting a pilot study with a quasi-experimental single group, using a pre-posttest design. In total, there were 39 participants distributed among three pilot courses. We collected and analyzed data on satisfaction, knowledge, and feasibility., RESULTS: The curriculum for a half-day course, consisting of 8 modules, showed almost excellent content validity (S-CVI = 0.92). In the pilot-implementation phase, participants were "very satisfied" with the pilot courses and a positive effect on their knowledge was detected. No correlation between satisfaction and knowledge gain was found., CONCLUSIONS: The CIPE intervention can be considered feasible and seems promising in its effects on satisfaction and knowledge. The insights gained in this study can be used to adapt and optimize the educational intervention, whereby the feedback from course attendees is particularly useful. Future studies need to further examine the effects in larger samples and more robust study designs.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment effects in trials with trauma-affected refugees vary considerably between studies, but the variability in outcome between individual patients is often overlooked. Consequently, we know little about why some patients benefit more from treatment than others. The aim of the study was therefore to identify predictors of treatment outcome for refugees with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)., METHODS: Data was derived from two randomised trials including 321 refugees, who had all participated in a 6-7 months bio-psycho-social treatment programme. Outcome measures were the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (PTSD, self-rating), Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (depression and anxiety, self-rating) and Hamilton Depression and Anxiety rating scales (observer-ratings). Using hierarchical regressions models, associations were analysed between pre- to post treatment score changes (dependent variable) and a range of variables including sociodemographics, pre-migration trauma, post-migratory stressors, baseline symptom scores and level of functioning., RESULTS: A high baseline score (=more symptoms) and a high level of functioning were found to be associated with improvement on all ratings. Additionally, the following variables were associated with symptom improvement on at least one outcome measure: short time in host country, full time occupation, young age and status as family reunified (in contrast to refugee status). Being Muslim was inversely correlated with improvement., LIMITATIONS: Translated self-ratings were used, which could impact reliability., CONCLUSION: These results call for screening and early interventions for arriving refugees. For clinical populations, level of functioning should be included in assessments of refugees, to possibly begin stratifying samples to different interventions based on their likelihood of responding.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have explored the implementation and impact of early childhood parenting education programs in very fragile contexts and humanitarian settings. We tested the effects of a group-based intervention, the Mother-Child Education Program (MOCEP), on parenting stress and practices among two refugee communities and one other marginalized community in Beirut, Lebanon., METHOD: A pilot wait-list RCT was conducted to assess the program's impact on maternal, child (average age: 4 years), and dyadic outcomes. A total of 106 mother-child dyads were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 53) or the wait-list control group (n = 53). Analysis was conducted by modified intention-to-treat and supplemental analyses through multiple imputation of missing post-intervention data., RESULTS: Forty families (38%) withdrew early from the study. After completing the program, mothers in the intervention group showed a reduction in their harsh parenting practices, as indexed by the Disciplinary Style Questionnaire (Cohen's d = -0.76, 95% CI = -1.24, -0.27) and in their level of parenting stress, as indexed by the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF; Cohen's d = -0.90, 95% CI = -1.39, -0.40). Exploratory but underpowered analyses of dyadic interactions revealed reductions in the PSI were associated with a reduction in harsh parenting after the intervention. However, we did not detect any positive impact on behavioral or emotional outcomes among the children., CONCLUSION: Our analyses suggest that MOCEP had a positive impact on disciplinary practices and parenting stress in a context of high fragility, but that broader effects on maternal and child outcomes may be dependent on program attendance and the availability of other services. We discuss implications of this pilot study for practice and research of a largely unexplored area of program evaluation., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Mother and Child Education Program in Palestinian Refugee Camps; https://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02402556.

N2  - PURPOSE: In the field of forced migration and mental health research, longitudinal studies with large sample sizes and rigorous methodology are lacking. Therefore, the Resettlement in Uprooted Groups Explored (REFUGE)-study was initiated in order to enhance current knowledge on mental health, quality of life and integration among adult refugees from Syria resettled in Norway. The main aims of the study are to investigate risk and protective factors for mental ill health in a longitudinal perspective; to trace mental health trajectories and investigate important modifiers of these trajectories and to explore the association between mental health and integration in the years following resettlement. The aims will be pursued by combining data from a longitudinal, three-wave questionnaire survey with data from population-based registries on education; work participation and sick-leave; healthcare utilisation and drug prescription. The goal is to incorporate the data in an internationally shared database, the REFUGE-database, where collaborating researchers may access and use data from the study as well as deposit data from similar studies., PARTICIPANTS: Adult (>=18 years), Syrian citizens who arrived in Norway as quota refugees, asylum seekers or through Norway's family reunion programme between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017. Of the initial 9990 sampled individuals for the first wave of the study (REFUGE-I), 8752 were reached by post or telephone and 902 responded (response rate=10.3%)., FINDINGS TO DATE: None published., FUTURE PLANS: The REFUGE-cohort study will conduct two additional data collections (2020 and 2021). Furthermore, questionnaire data will be linked to population-based registries after all three waves of data collection have been completed. Registry data will be obtained for time-periods both prior to and after the survey data collection points. Finally, pending ethics approval, we will begin the process of merging the Norwegian REFUGE-cohort with existing datasets in Sweden, establishing the extended REFUGE-database., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClincalTrials.gov Registry (NCT03742128).

N2  - Migrant workers may experience higher burdens of occupational injury and illness compared to native-born workers, which may be due to the differential exposure to occupational hazards, differential vulnerability to exposure-associated health impacts, or both. This study aims to assess if the relationships between psychosocial job characteristics and mental health vary by migrant status in Australia (differential vulnerability). A total of 8969 persons from wave 14 (2014-2015) of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey were included in the analysis. Psychosocial job characteristics included skill discretion, decision authority and job insecurity. Mental health was assessed via a Mental Health Inventory-5 score (MHI-5), with a higher score indicating better mental health. Migrant status was defined by (i) country of birth (COB), (ii) the combination of COB and English/Non-English dominant language of COB and (iii) the combination of COB and years since arrival in Australia. Data were analysed using linear regression, adjusting for gender, age and educational attainment. Migrant status was analysed as an effect modifier of the relationships between psychosocial job characteristics and mental health. Skill discretion and decision authority were positively associated with the MHI-5 score while job insecurity was negatively associated with the MHI-5 score. We found no statistical evidence of migrant status acting as an effect modifier of the psychosocial job characteristic-MHI-5 relationships. With respect to psychosocial job characteristic-mental health relationships, these results suggest that differential exposure to job stressors is a more important mechanism than differential vulnerability for generating occupational health inequities between migrants and native-born workers in Australia.

N2  - Objective: To explore the moderating effect of sense of coherence in the relationship between occupational stress and depression. Methods: From June to September in 2018, migrant workers were purposively selected from the urban (including office buildings, shopping malls, barber shops or restaurants and other service enterprises) and suburban (including microelectronics, internet, clothing processing and art design and other factories) areas of Shanghai. A total of 3 034 people were investigated and 2 573 valid questionnaires were collected. Patient health questionnaire (PHQ), sense of coherence questionnaire (SOC) and job content questionnaire (JCQ) were used to investigate the levels depression, sense of coherence and occupational stress. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze the moderating effect of sense of coherence on occupational stress and depression, and SPSS PROCESS macro program and Bootstrap method were used to further explore the moderating effect of sense of coherence. Results: The age of total 2 573 migrant workers was (28.24+/-7.33) years old and 49.79% of them were males. The scores of depression, occupational stress and sense of coherence were 6.67+/-4.74, 28.45+/-4.38 and 62.02+/-10.89, respectively. The depression level was positively correlated with occupational stress (r=0.33, P=0.007), and negatively correlated with sense of coherence (r=-0.53, P=0.003). The hierarchy regression analysis suggested that the interaction between occupational stress and sense of coherence was associated with depression symptom (beta=-0.07, P=0.001). Bootstrap analysis showed that occupational stress was not associated with depression symptom with high level of sense of sense of coherence (beta=0.04, 95%CI=-0.01-0.10), while occupational stress was associated with depression symptom with low level of sense of sense of coherence (beta=0.19, 95%CI=0.14-0.23). Conclusion:  The high level of sense of coherence has a moderating effect on the relationship between occupational stress and depressive symptoms, while the low level of sense of coherence does not have this effect.

N2  - At the end of 2018, almost 1/5th of Sweden's population were migrants (born abroad). Migrants in Sweden, including refugee migrants, have higher risks for psychosis and PTSD, but lower risks for alcohol dependence and suicide than Swedish-born. Regarding depression and anxiety, refugees have a higher risk than other foreign-born people, but it is unclear whether other foreign-born persons are at higher risk than Swedish-born. Asylum seekers and refugees seem particularly vulnerable to poor mental health, and this is especially apparent for so called unaccompanied migrant minors. Health-promoting factors are social inclusion with work or education for adults, and preschool and school for children and adolescents.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Because of demographic changes the nursing care sector is faced with a lack of qualified employees in the medium and long term. The shortage in the work force is caused by high workloads and unfavorable working conditions. In response to this shortage, there have been attempts to recruit qualified nursing staff from abroad and also to improve the integration of people with a migration background living in Germany into the job market., METHODOLOGY: Based on a quantitative cross-sectional study of 366 nurses, the psychosocial burden and strains among employees with a migration background (n= 112) and without a migration background (n= 254) were examined. For this purpose, 13 scales of the German version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) were used for the assessment of psychosocial factors at work. The results were compared with professional group-specific reference values (geriatric care) from the COPSOQ database., RESULTS: The comparison of nursing staff with and without a migration background revealed that the emotional demands, work-privacy conflict and role conflicts factors received a significantly better rating among nursing staff with a migration background, while development opportunities were rated worse by this population group. The surveyed nursing staff exhibited higher stress values compared to the COPSOQ reference group in almost all scales., CONCLUSION: Nursing staff with a migration background need to be supported with respect to development opportunities. Suitable education and training measures may offer adequate career perspectives and may encourage employees to stay in their jobs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Migrant women at risk of social exclusion often experience health inequities based on gender, country of origin or socioeconomic status. Traditional health promotion programs designed for this population have focused on covering their basic needs or modifying lifestyle behaviors. The salutogenic model of health could offer a new perspective enabling health promotion programs to reduce the impact of health inequities. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a salutogenic health promotion program focused on the empowerment of migrant women at risk of social exclusion., METHODS: A four-session salutogenic health promotion program was conducted over a period of 6 months. In a quasi-experimental pre-test post-test design, an ad hoc questionnaire was administered to 26 women to collect sociodemographic data, together with 5 validated instruments: Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence (SOC-13), Duke-UNC-11 (perceived social support), Quality of Life Short Form-36 (SF-36), Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, and the Cohen et al. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression models were performed. Statistical tests were considered significant with a two-tailed p value < 0.05., RESULTS: Participants had a low initial SOC-13 score (60.36; SD 8.16), which did not show significant change after the health promotion program. Perceived social support (37.07; SD 6.28) and mental quality of life also remained unchanged, while physical quality of life increased from 50.84 (SD 4.60) to 53.08 (SD 5.31) (p = 0.049). Self-esteem showed an increasing trend from 30.14 (SD 4.21) to 31.92 (SD 4.38) (p = 0.120). Perceived stress decreased from 20.57 (SD 2.91) to 18.38 (SD 3.78) (p = 0.016). A greater effect was observed at the end of the program in women with lower initial scores for SOC-13 and quality of life and higher initial scores of perceived stress., CONCLUSIONS: The health promotion program reduced perceived stress, increased physical quality of life and showed a trend toward increased self-esteem, especially among migrant women with multiple vulnerability factors. The salutogenic model of health should be considered as a good practice to apply in health promotion programs and to be included in national policies to reduce health inequity in migrant populations.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Trait emotional intelligence has recently emerged as a negative predictor of work-related distress. However, research that considers the mechanisms underlying the relationship between trait emotional intelligence and distress is lacking, in particular among workers with emotionally intensive occupations. The purpose of this study was to analyze the mediating pathway of coping behaviors in the relations between trait emotional intelligence, and work-related distress outcomes, namely secondary traumatic stress and job burnout in a sample of refugee resettlement workers., METHOD: Participants were 210 resettlement workers from six organizations in the United States who completed a questionnaire. Questions included self-reported measures of secondary traumatic stress, burnout, trait emotional intelligence, coping behaviors, and history of trauma. The majority of participants identified as White (64.9%) and female (73.6%). The average participant was 32.96 years old (SD = 10.22) and was employed in the same position for 2.64 years (SD = 4.67)., RESULTS: Unhealthy coping (e.g., substance use and denial), emerged as a significant mediator of the relations between trait emotional intelligence and the outcomes, with 43% and 64% of the total effects for secondary traumatic stress and burnout mediated. Specifically, trait emotional intelligence negatively related to secondary traumatic stress and burnout via a reduction in unhealthy coping behaviors, rather than an increase in healthy coping ones., CONCLUSIONS: Training programs promoting the psychological well-being of employees often focus on the promotion of healthy coping practices. These results suggest the potential value of including trait emotional intelligence training in the development of such programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - We present a clinical case in occupational health nursing where the worker was showing symptoms of stress caused by a change of residence and related factors at work. A nursing assessment was made following Leininger's theory of Care Diversity and Universality and Sunrise Model, considered suitable for the case. After the assessment, it was determined that the factors associated with the migratory event triggered the reported symptoms, and a care plan was drawn up with monthly telephone contact follow-up and reassessment at 3months. A holistic approach containing social and cultural elements, together with the use of standardised nurse language are very useful in cases such as the one presented.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies from around the world have shown that women living as undocumented migrants have limited and deficient access to perinatal care, increasing their risks of both physical and psychological complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Failures to provide equal access to healthcare have been criticized extensively by the United Nations. In 2013, undocumented migrants' rights to healthcare in Sweden were expanded to include full access to perinatal care. Research surrounding clinical encounters involving women living as undocumented migrants remains largely lacking. The present study aimed to provide a composite description of women's experiences of clinical encounters throughout pregnancy and childbirth, when living as undocumented migrants in Sweden., METHODS: Taking an inductive approach, qualitative content analysis was implemented. Thirteen women from ten different countries were interviewed. Meaning-units were extracted from the data collected in order to identify emergent overarching themes., RESULTS: In clinical encounters where healthcare professionals displayed empathic concern and listening behaviours, women felt empowered, acknowledged, and encouraged, leading them to trust clinicians, diminishing fears relating to seeking healthcare services. Conversely, when neglectful behaviour on part of healthcare professionals was perceived in encounters, anxiousness and fear intensified. Vulnerability and distress induced by the women's uncertain living circumstances were apparent across themes, and appeared exacerbated by traumatic memories, difficulties in coping with motherhood, and fears of deportation., CONCLUSION: The present study contributes unique and important knowledge surrounding women's experience of being pregnant and giving birth when living as undocumented migrants. The overarching findings indicated that the needs of undocumented migrant women were largely similar to those of all expectant mothers, but that due to vulnerabilities relating to their circumstances, flexible and informed care provision is essential. Being knowledgeable on undocumented migrants' rights to healthcare is vital, as clinical encounters appeared highly consequential to the women's well-being and help-seeking behaviours. Negative encounters inflicted emotional distress and fear. Contrastingly, positive encounters promoted trust in clinicians, personal empowerment, and relief. Positive clinical encounters could provide rare opportunities to assist an otherwise elusive population at increased risk for both physical and psychological complications, highlighting the crucial need for adherence to ethical principles in clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Stress is pervasive among Latino immigrants. We identified seasonal and occupational patterns in stress among rural Latino immigrants., METHODS: During three agricultural periods, farmworker and non-farmworker participants responded to a 24-item stress questionnaire (Snipes et al, 2007). We measured the associations of stress with occupation, with season, and occupation within season, adjusting for demographic variables., RESULTS: The highest levels of stress were observed in the pre-thinning season when pruning takes place among farmworkers. Stress is significantly higher in farmworkers compared with non-farmworkers only in the non-spray season when crops are dormant. Higher income was associated with decreased stress in the pre-thinning and thinning seasons when buds and small fruit are removed from orchards., CONCLUSIONS: Identification of strategies to reduce stress in Latino migrants is warranted. Although some sources of stress may be intractable, others may be amenable to intervention.

N2  - The Syrian War has created a mass exodus of Syrian citizens to neighboring countries and exposed them to many atrocities. We explored factors affecting well-being and posttraumatic growth (PTG) of refugees residing in Jordan. Participants (N = 250) were surveyed via nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Outcome criteria included a global well-being rating and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Trauma exposure assessment included The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and The War Events Questionnaire. Ordinary least squares regression examined associations between potential contributors to refugee well-being and PTG, including work, age, sex, income, education, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity, physical pain, health, NGO assistance, psychotic/affective mental disorder, and length of residence in Jordan. Mean participant score on the PTSD-HTQ scale was 2.37 (SD = 0.63; range: 1 [no symptoms] to 3.88 [extremely severe symptoms]). Additionally, 74.6% of participants received NGO assistance and 92.7% experienced war events. Univariate and multivariate results indicated enhancement of well-being was associated with income, r = .34, beta = .26, p < .001; health, r = .35, beta = .26, p = .001; and absence of affective disorder, r = -.31, beta = -.18, p = .012; and that PTG increased in association with income, r = .28, beta = .20, p = .007; NGO assistance, r = .07, beta = .14, p = .045; and absence of psychosis, r = -.12, beta = -.17, p = .013, and affective disorder, r = -.26; beta = -.16, p = .033. Findings suggest sufficient income and humanitarian assistance can contribute to Syrian refugees' mental health. Copyright © 2018 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

N2  - In predominately immigrant neighborhoods, the nuances of immigrant life in the ethnic enclave have important, yet underappreciated impact on community health. The complexities of immigrant experiences are essential to unpacking and addressing the impact of acculturative processes on observed racial, ethnic, and class-based health disparities in the United States. These insights because they are largely unexplored are best captured qualitatively through academic-community research partnership. We established the participatory mixed method Little Village participatory community health assessment (CHA) to explore community health in an ethnic enclave. In this paper, we share findings from our qualitative component exploring: how do Residents in a Predominately Immigrant Neighborhood Perceive Community Health Needs and Assets in Little Village. Three major themes emerged: rich, health promoting community assets inherent in the ethnic enclave; cumulative chronic stress impacting the mental health of families and intra-familial strain; and, work and occupation as important but underappreciated community health determinants in an immigrant neighborhood. These nuanced findings enhanced our community health assessment and contributed to the development of two additional tailored CHA methods, a community member-administered Community Health Survey, and an oral history component that provided deeper insight on the community's health needs and assets, and a focus for action on work as a social determinant of health at the community level. Conducting trusted community-driven health assessments that are adaptive and flexible to capture authentic needs and assets are critical, given health consequences of the new anti-immigrant rhetoric and growing socio-political tensions and fear in immigrant neighborhoods in the United States.

N2  - PURPOSE: U.S. Latino parents of adolescents face unprecedented threats to family stability and well-being due to rapid and far-reaching transformations in U.S. immigration policy., METHODS: Two hundred thirteen Latino parents of adolescents were recruited from community settings in a suburb of a large mid-Atlantic city to complete surveys assessing parents' psychological distress and responses to immigration actions and news. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to describe the prevalence of parents' responses to immigration news and actions across diverse residency statuses. Multiple logistic regression models examined associations between immigration-related impacts and the odds of a parent's high psychological distress., RESULTS: Permanent residents, temporary protected status, and undocumented parents reported significantly more negative immigration impacts on psychological states than U.S. citizens. Parents reporting frequent negative immigration-related impacts had a significantly higher likelihood of high psychological distress than did other parents, and these associations were maintained even when accounting for parents' residency status, gender, education, and experience with deportation or detention. The odds of a parent reporting high psychological distress due to negative immigration impacts ranged from 2.2 (p < .05) to 10.4 (p < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first empirical accounts of how recent immigration policy changes and news have impacted the lives of Latino families raising adolescent children. Harmful impacts were manifest across a range of parent concerns and behaviors and are strong correlates of psychological distress. Findings suggest a need to consider pathways to citizenship for Latina/o parents so that these parents, many of whom are legal residents, may effectively care for their children.

N2  - Little is known about how psychosocial work factors such as work stress, supervisor fairness, and language barriers affect risk of occupational injury among Latino farmworkers. This study attempts to address these questions. Surveys were administered via interviews to 225 Latino thoroughbred farmworkers. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of occupational injury in the past year in relation to occupational characteristics. Work stress (OR 6.70, 95% CI 1.84-24.31), supervisor unfairness (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.14-9.73), longer tenure at farm (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.13-6.34), and supervisor inability to speak Spanish (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.05-5.00) were significantly associated with increased odds of occupational injury. Due to the associations between work stress, supervisor unfairness, supervisor inability to speak Spanish and injury, supervisor training to improve Spanish language ability and equitable management practices is merited. Future research is needed to understand the antecedents of work stress for Latino farmworkers.

N2  - Cross-cultural research in neuropsychological assessment has primarily focused on Hispanic and African American populations. Less is known about the impact of language, culture, education, socioeconomic factors, and life experiences on assessment for other cultural groups. We highlight the methodological and cross-cultural barriers encountered at each stage of the neuropsychological assessment of Arabic- and Burmese-speaking refugees, who were culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD). A total of 18 refugees (13 men/five women; in their 20-50s) who were victims of torture in their countries of origin, some with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and now residents in New Zealand, were seen for neuropsychological assessment. Measures were officially translated, back translated, and administered with the assistance of professional interpreters. Multiple challenges arose in terms of administration (e.g., use of interpreters, interactions with the tester, assessment environment, assessment experience, and motivation), scoring, and interpretation (e.g., age appropriate scoring, estimation of prior function, estimation of brain injury severity, obtaining collateral information), the tests themselves, and ecological validity. There are more challenges in the neuropsychological assessment of people who are CALD than can be managed by adhering to current guidelines. The best approach is to find a balance between maintaining assessment integrity and working creatively and sensitively with this group.

N2  - Acculturation to the culture of the host society as well as to one's heritage culture have been shown to impact immigrants' adjustment during the years following resettlement. While acculturation has been identified as an important factor in adjustment of Vietnamese immigrants (Birman and Tran in Am J Orthopsychiatr 78(1):109-120. doi: 10.1037/0002-9432.78.1.109 , 2008), no clear pattern of findings has emerged and too few studies have employed an ecological approach. The purpose of this paper is to contextualize the study of acculturation and adjustment by taking an ecological approach to exploring these relationships across several life domains, using a bilinear scale, and examining mediators of these relationships for adult Vietnamese refugees (N = 203) in the United States. We call this approach the Ecological Acculturation Framework (EAF). Results of a structural equation model (SEM) showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between American acculturation and psychological distress, demonstrating that this relationship was specific to an occupational domain. However, while Vietnamese acculturation predicted co-ethnic social support satisfaction, it did not predict reduced psychological distress. Implications for a life domains approach, including domain specificity, are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Internal migrant workers are a large population in China. Current health related studies among this population mainly focused on infectious disease, maternal health and occupational diseases and injuries. However, very limited studies were paid attention to mental health of migrant workers though it is an important public health issue., AIMS: The current study aims to understand prevalence of depression symptoms and factors associated with depression among Chinese migrant workers using novel methods to develop a comprehensive sample., METHODS: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) was employed to recruit the target population, who are required 1) not to hold a hukou indicative of living in central areas or near suburbs of Chengdu city; 2) to be 16 years or older; 3) not to be a student. The Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure depression symptoms of migrant workers. And then Structural Equation Model (SEM) was applied to explore factors associated with depression among Chinese migrant workers., RESULTS: Among 1180 migrant workers, 23.7% of them had clinically relevant depression symptoms (CES-D score >= 16), and 12.8% were consistent with a clinical diagnosis of depression (CES-D score >= 21). Self-rated economic status, city adaptation status, and self-rated health had negative effects on depression. Social economic status (SES) affected depression, and was mediated by self-rated economic status and self-rated health. City adaptation status was affected by length of residence in the city, satisfaction with one's job, and the social support that one could obtain while living in the city., CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated a higher prevalence of depression symptoms among migrant workers comparing to general population reported by previous studies, identified possible factors associated with depression symptoms, and also explored relationships between these factors. Our study provides a model to understand mental health of Chinese internal migrant workers and to generate important research questions for the future. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Despite its high prevalence, depression is often unrecognized and untreated in minority immigrants. Culture and environment influence perceptions of depression. The purpose of this study was to understand perceptions of depression (knowledge and coping mechanisms) in Korean American immigrants using focus group discussions. A convenience sample (n = 28) was recruited from Korean communities in the Puget Sound region of Washington State. Participants lacked an understanding of depression. Difficulties from immigration-related environmental changes were the main sources of stress. Immigration-related environmental changes resulted in changes in coping resources. Culture-friendly education and coping resources might benefit this minority group.

N2  - Within seven years after the end of the Nicaraguan civil war in 1990, forced migrants, whose lives had been most disrupted by the conflict, were self-settled in a squatter community in the capital city of Managua and lived in extreme poverty with minimal health, education, security and social service supports. Compared with voluntary migrant neighbours, whose lives had been less affected by the conflict, forced migrants exhibited equal clinically significant symptoms of physical and mental health and psychosocial maladaptation. These findings run counter to generally held theory and assumptions about the negative long-lasting effects of the trauma and stress of war, forced migration and resettlement. Explanations are offered to explain the discrepancies between theory and the study findings as well as the dominance of poverty and socioeconomic status. Implications are also drawn for increasing social support and other durable forms of assistance that emerge from the study as important to meeting the needs of equally poor and unhealthy forced and voluntary migrants in proliferating squatter communities throughout the Third World.

N2  - The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the associations between migration stressors and psychological distress among Thai migrant agricultural workers in Israel, and to examine the direct and indirect contribution of socio-cultural variables to this relationship. Two hundred and twenty-one Thai male workers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that included demographic variables and occupational exposures to organophosphate pesticides (as control variables), migration stressors, intervening variables (traditional health beliefs, social support, drinking behavior, and utilization of medical services), and a psychological distress scale. In multivariate analysis, migration stressors, the migrants' traditional health beliefs, quality of current social relationships, drinking behavior, as well as age and occupational exposure were significantly associated with psychological distress. Workers who reported higher migration stressors (perceived the migration to be difficult, and often felt homesick), those with higher levels of traditional health beliefs, those whose social relationships with other Thai co-workers were poor, those who consumed either no alcohol or large amounts of alcohol, and those who reported 'problem drinking' had significantly higher levels of psychological distress. A moderating effect of the quality of social relationships with co-workers on the association between homesickness and psychological distress was found. Additionally, migrants aged 28-34 and those who were experiencing eye irritation from chemicals at work had significantly increased levels of distress. The findings demonstrate the focal role of specific migration stressors and the current socio-cultural context on psychological distress of migrant workers.

N2  - This paper reviews the historical aspects of expatriate mental health, and comments on the paucity of literature in the medical and psychiatric journals. Data obtained from 397 expatriate probands examined during overseas service are described. It was noted that there was a high incidence of affective and adjustment disorders. The results showed six areas significantly related to those with affective disorders at interview, namely a history of consultation for psychological problems in out-patient departments or with the patient's own doctor, a history of depressed mood, and a family history of suicide, psychosis or personality disorder. Subjects with adjustment disorders at interview showed a significant positive correlation with four stressors (occupational anxiety, home country anxieties, acculturation and physical ill-health), but showed a negative association with a past personal history of consultation for psychological problems at out-patient departments or with their own doctors. These findings are discussed and practical applications suggested for improving expatriate mental health.

N2  - Since Afghan refugees began coming to the United States in the early 1980s, the Afghan community of the San Francisco Bay Area has become the largest in the United States. This population copes with a number of stressors that negatively affect their health and psychological well-being. Based on an ethnographic study, we focus on the social context in which Afghan refugees find themselves, describing Afghans' perceptions of their interactions with mainstream American citizens and health and social service providers. The theme running through all such interactions is information--its scarcity, character, and cultural differences in type, purposes, and means of transmission. Quotes from interviews illustrate four types of problems: economic and occupational problems, health-care access, family and children's issues, and immigration issues/ethnic bias. Policy and program recommendations are applicable to other recent refugee populations that experience similar information problems with regard to the dominant society.

N2  - A number of recently-arrived refugees who are suffering from psychological disturbances and physical injuries that have resulted from torture or severe trauma has come to the attention of welfare workers and health personnel in New South Wales. A tentative estimate of more than 2000 refugees in New South Wales who are so affected, and clear evidence of extensive human rights abuses in the countries from which they came, indicate an urgent need for specialized care for the victims. Organized violence, including detention, torture and severe deprivation, is a tool of governments in many countries of the world. The varied forms of torture are all designed to destroy the trust, personality and self-esteem of the victims and to foster dependency, debility and dread, both in the victims and in the societies in which they live. Those persons who survive torture and detention often are affected severely in body, mind and spirit. Many victims exhibit acute and chronic symptoms that are described commonly by the diagnostic categories "post-traumatic stress disorder" and "torture syndrome". Their kin, especially spouses and children, also suffer psychological and familial disturbances frequently, as a result of the arrest, detention and torture of the victim. Their suffering is compounded by the distress of fleeing their home country and the stresses of adjusting to a new country and way of life. In Europe and North America, services have been established to treat and to rehabilitate sufferers of these disorders. Treatment programmes differ in structure and size, but include commonly psychotherapy, physiotherapy, specialized medical care and parallel assistance with resettlement and social adjustment for both the patients and their families. This article cites illustrative case material from New South Wales and summarizes the recommendations for a community-based rehabilitation service for victims both of torture and of other forms of organized violence, such as detention in "re-education" camps or the genocide in Kampuchea.

N2  - Research has established a link between financial challenges and mental health outcomes. Understanding this linkage among low-income Latinas who face unique experiences and challenges in relation to managing their household finances is important. This study utilized a community-based participatory qualitative research method to explore perspectives on financial and mental health among Latinas residing in Los Angeles County. Three focus groups were conducted with mainly immigrant, Spanish-speaking, low-income Latinas (n = 37). The study found that, though participants face financial stressors tied to managing finances, they were eager to learn new skills and tools for improved financial practices and mental health therapies. For financial education interventions targeted to Latinas, it is best to use interventions that incorporate peer support groups, improve knowledge about financial management tools and financial products available in the community, and therapeutic interventions to address financial stress.

The structured questionnaire disseminated for the study was designed to measure health-related quality of life, health-promotion behaviors, barriers, resources, and perceptual factors. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Health-promotion behaviors and self-efficacy have significant positive direct effects on health-related quality of life, and acculturative stress has a significant negative direct effect on health-related quality of life. These findings suggest that certain strategies are needed for developing health-promotion programs aimed at the betterment of migrant workers' health-related quality of life. Specifically, health-promotion behaviors and self-efficacy among migrant workers should be encouraged, and strategies for decreasing their acculturative stress should be formulated.

N2  - The study asked a defined question, "What are the potential merit or validity of writing a culturally competent manual integrated with CBT intervention to treat PTSD symptoms in the Iranian population living in USA". The population of this study was twenty mental health professionals with experience working with Iranian culture, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and PTSD. Utilizing a qualitative research with Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), through an online, open ended questionnaire survey, the study discovered from participants responses, clinicians don't have specific training in Iranian culture, CBT and PTSD to prepare them for providing services. Based on the findings, the author recommends a competent manual including, culture, CBT and PTSD training to address the needs of the therapists in the field.

N2  - Relatively few studies have been conducted on the physical and mental health needs of Mexican Migrant farmworkers, a population that is rapidly increasing in the United States. Of the literature available, depressive and anxious symptomatology are alarmingly prevalent. This qualitative descriptive study seeks to assess the mental and physical health needs of a particular H-2A Mexican farmworking community in southeastern United States. Utilizing a community based participatory approach, a needs assessment was conducted through the use of two focus groups with farmworkers (N = 16) and individual interviews with key informants (N = 3). Thematic Analysis revealed the presence of several physical and mental health stressors: weather conditions, separation from family, isolation, financial concerns, and barriers to mental health care. Despite the experience of psychological stress, several adaptive coping strategies alongside employer support and cultural factors fostered resiliency among the farmworkers in this study. Consistent with a community based participatory approach, the results of the thematic analysis of the data will be disseminated to the community in order to add to their knowledge of the needs of the community as well as empower them to take initial steps towards achieving mental health.

N2  - Objective: Syrians have been the largest group among asylum seekers in Germany since 2014. Refugees are exposed to various risks along the migration process, indicating the need for adequate psychosocial support. Following the advice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to consult the target group, this is the first study qualitatively investigating the perspectives on mental health and coping strategies of Syrian refugees in Germany. Methods: A qualitative design with semi-structured focus group discussions was applied. Three focus groups with a total of N = 20 participants were conducted. Focus group discussions were analyzed using content-structuring content analysis. Results: Hopelessness, fear, and worries were reported most frequently as emotional consequences of war, fleeing, and resettlement, along with cognitive, physical, social, and behavioral consequences. Among the reported consequences, symptoms of PTSD were identified. Contrary to depression and schizophrenia, PTSD was not explicitly mentioned. Possibilities of coping and support referred to meeting basic needs (e.g., mental health care), fostering participation and personal coping, with the social network stated as most important source of support. Barriers of accessing mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services included poor information, stigma, and language difficulties. Conclusion: In contrast to earlier research, Syrian refugees reported numerous emotional symptoms as well as mental disorders as consequences of war, fleeing, and resettlement, indicating awareness of mental health sequelae. However, PTSD was not reported as possible consequence. The findings indicate the need for adequate psychoeducation, matching the participants' wish for improved information on mental health to reduce barriers accessing MHPSS.

N2  - Damaged self-esteem can explain the negative effects of various job stresses on depressive symptoms of migrant workers. Social support may threaten workers' self-esteem in highly stressful environments, and in turn worsen their mental health. This study aimed to examine the indirect role of self-esteem in the relationship between job stress and depressive symptoms among migrant workers in Macau and whether this indirect effect is modified by social support. A sample of 900 mainland Chinese migrant workers was recruited into the study. Job stress, social support, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms were measured. Conditional process analysis was used to examine the proposed moderated mediation model. Job stress was associated with depressive symptoms through lower self-esteem. The indirect effect of job stress on depressive symptoms via decreased self-esteem was significant among migrant workers with higher levels of social support, but not among migrant workers with lower levels of social support. Our findings suggest that when migrant workers perceive a high level of social support, job stress is more likely to threaten their self-esteem and in turn increase their risk for depression. Future efforts aimed at promoting the mental health of migrant workers need to tailor interventions to avoid the threatening effect of social support on self-esteem in job environments with high stress.

N2  - Aims: In the past few years, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of forcibly displaced migrants worldwide, of which a substantial proportion is refugees and asylum seekers. Refugees and asylum seekers may experience high levels of psychological distress, and show high rates of mental health conditions. It is therefore timely and particularly relevant to assess whether current evidence supports the provision of psychosocial interventions for this population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and acceptability of psychosocial interventions compared with control conditions (treatment as usual/no treatment, waiting list, psychological placebo) aimed at reducing mental health problems in distressed refugees and asylum seekers. Methods: We used Cochrane procedures for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. We searched for published and unpublished RCTs assessing the efficacy and acceptability of psychosocial interventions in adults and children asylum seekers and refugees with psychological distress. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive and anxiety symptoms at post-intervention were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include: PTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms at follow-up, functioning, quality of life and dropouts due to any reason. Results: We included 26 studies with 1959 participants. Meta-analysis of RCTs revealed that psychosocial interventions have a clinically significant beneficial effect on PTSD (standardised mean difference [SMD] = -0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.01 to -0.41; I2 = 83%; 95% CI 78-88; 20 studies, 1370 participants; moderate quality evidence), depression (SMD = -1.02; 95% CI -1.52 to -0.51; I2 = 89%; 95% CI 82-93; 12 studies, 844 participants; moderate quality evidence) and anxiety outcomes (SMD = -1.05; 95% CI -1.55 to -0.56; I2 = 87%; 95% CI 79-92; 11 studies, 815 participants; moderate quality evidence). This beneficial effect was maintained at 1 month or longer follow-up, which is extremely important for populations exposed to ongoing post-migration stressors. For the other secondary outcomes, we identified a non-significant trend in favour of psychosocial interventions. Most evidence supported interventions based on cognitive behavioural therapies with a trauma-focused component. Limitations of this review include the limited number of studies collected, with a relatively low total number of participants, and the limited available data for positive outcomes like functioning and quality of life. Conclusions: Considering the epidemiological relevance of psychological distress and mental health conditions in refugees and asylum seekers, and in view of the existing data on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions, these interventions should be routinely made available as part of the health care of distressed refugees and asylum seekers. Evidence-based guidelines and implementation packages should be developed accordingly. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: To date, most studies on the mental health of refugees in Europe have focused on the prevalence and treatment of psychopathology. Little is known about those who illegally reside in the host country, referred to, in the Netherlands, as undocumented asylum seekers. There are indications that mental health and psychosocial problems are more prevalent in this group than among refugees in general, with unsatisfactory treatment outcomes. Objective: To describe characteristics and mental health and psychosocial problems of undocumented asylum seekers, and to establish the need for, and feasibility of, a tailored treatment approach. Method: Based on a literature review and extensive clinical experience, common mental health and psychosocial problems and accessibility of care for undocumented asylum seekers are established, as well as the common treatment approach in the Netherlands. A tailored treatment programme and experiences with its implementation are described. Results: Mental health and psychosocial problems are highly prevalent among undocumented asylum seekers, and access to care is limited. In addition, treatment in the Netherlands, if provided, is mostly insufficient yet prolonged. Given the specific psychosocial problems and living conditions of undocumented asylum seekers, a necessary criterion to enable adequate and evidence-based treatment provision is acknowledgement of their distinct needs. A tailored treatment programme as currently implemented in the Netherlands appears to meet this criterion and be feasible under certain conditions. Collaboration between mental health care providers and involved social service and governmental parties by regular meetings, though complicated, is a relevant element. Conclusions: Even though undocumented asylum seekers are illegally residing in a country, medical ethics and the human rights perspective necessitate for adequate and evidence-based treatment for those among them with mental health problems. The tailored treatment approach presented here suggests that, notwithstanding factors complicating care provision which require specific attention, this is feasible. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)Abstract (Spanish)Antecedentes: Hasta la fecha, la mayoria de los estudios sobre la salud mental de los refugiados en Europa se han centrado en la prevalencia y el tratamiento de la psicopatologia. Sin embargo, poco se sabe acerca de aquellos que residen ilegalmente en el pais que le acoge, en los Paises Bajos, en su mayoria referidos como solicitantes de asilo indocumentados. Hay indicios de que la salud mental y los problemas psicosociales son mas frecuentes en este grupo, que entre los refugiados en general, con resultados de tratamiento insatisfactorios. Objetivo: Describir las caracteristicas y los problemas psicosociales y de salud mental de los solicitantes de asilo indocumentados, y establecer la necesidad y la viabilidad de un enfoque de tratamiento personalizado. Metodo: Basado en una revision de la literatura y una amplia experiencia clinica, se establecen problemas comunes de salud mental y psicosociales y acceso a la atencion para solicitantes de asilo indocumentados, asi como el enfoque de tratamiento comun en los Paises Bajos. Se describe un programa de tratamiento a medida y experiencias con su implementacion. Resultados: La salud mental y los problemas psicosociales son muy frecuentes entre los solicitantes de asilo indocumentados, y el acceso a la atencion es limitado. Ademas, el tratamiento en los Paises Bajos, si se proporciona, es en su mayoria insuficiente y prolongado. Dados los problemas psicosociales especificos y las condiciones de vida de los solicitantes de asilo indocumentados, un criterio necesario para permitir una provision de tratamiento adecuada y basada en la evidencia es el reconocimiento de sus necesidades especificas. Un programa de tratamiento a medida como se implementa actualmente en los Paises Bajos parece cumplir con este criterio y ser factible bajo ciertas condiciones. La colaboracion entre los proveedores de atencion de salud mental y el servicio social involucrado y las partes gubernamentales mediante reuniones periodicas, aunque complicadas, es un elemento relevante. Conclusiones: A pesar de que los solicitantes de asilo indocumentados residen ilegalmente en un pais, por etica medica y perspectiva de los derechos humanos, aquellos con problemas de salud mental, requieren un tratamiento adecuado y basado en la evidencia. El enfoque de tratamiento personalizado presentado aqui sugiere que, a pesar de los factores que complican la provision de atencion que requieren atencion especifica, esto es factible.

N2  - Millions of people today experience human rights violations (HRV) worldwide. Many groups live under conditions that make them vulnerable and being exposed to HRV under such conditions can have devastating consequences. Violations represent grave problems for public health and also disturb the democratic foundations of a society. This chapter discusses a human rights perspective on mental health problems caused by HRV and how attacks on the fundamental right to be a human affect psychological functioning. It first shortly presents the international system of conventions that attempts to regulate and prohibit the violation of basic human rights. Every human being's uniqueness is what entitles them to ethical treatment and human rights. Human rights are situated on three pillars: ethics and moral principles, laws/conventions and declarations on human rights, and basic philosophical principles related to being human. Being exposed to gross human rights violations, especially torture, affects basic systems of security, exposes the self to humiliation and shaming and sets forth a cascade of anxiety-provoking fantasies. Psychoanalytic therapy has a historical perspective and works with problems related to the self and self-image. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - There is a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugee and asylum seeker populations which can pose distinct challenges for mental health professionals. This review included 16 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1111 participants investigating the effect of psychological interventions on PTSD in these populations. We searched PsychInfo, ProQuest (including selected databases ASSIA, IBSS, PILOTS), Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Studies (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews (CDSR) to identify peer-reviewed, primary research articles up to May 2018. We used rigorous methods to assess the quality of included trials and evidence using Cochrane, SURE and GRADE systems. 525 trials were reviewed, 16 were included with 15 contributed to meta-analyses. Despite the challenges of conducting research in this field we found evidence for trauma-focused psychological interventions for PTSD in this population. Following sub-group analyses, we found evidence to support the use of EMDR and Narrative Exposure Therapy for PTSD symptoms. We considered these findings in relation to the broader PTSD treatment literature and related literature from survivors of large scale conflict. These findings suggest that trauma focused psychological therapies can be effective in improving symptoms for refugees and asylum seekers with PTSD.

N2  - This phenomenological study aims to better understand the applicability of Dance/Movement therapy for traumatised women asylum seekers and refugees. It explores if and how bodily engagement could support an existing resilience based treatment model employed at a centre for transcultural psychiatry in the Netherlands. The sessions focused on moving the body and included the use of music, props, mirroring techniques, body awareness and movement exploration exercises. Participation in the sessions was associated with self-reported alleviation of stress and addressed vulnerabilities. Additionally, movement and bodily engagement offered opportunities for body awareness, and interconnectedness with other group members. A key finding was that Dance/Movement therapy provided a shared safe psychological space for self-expression among this vulnerable population, and can be incorporated into a resilience based treatment programme with adaptations for context.

N2  - The process of transition to motherhood that brings along a number of vital changes may be full of risks and difficulties for immigrant mothers. Poverty, being unfamiliar with the language of the country that the mother migrated, inability of healthcare policies in covering healthcare expenses of immigrants, insufficiency of social assistance and loneliness may negatively affect health of mother and infant. Postpartum immigrant mothers are seen depression, anxiety, stress and social isolation because of these obstacles. Therefore, health care professionals, who provide care to immigrant mothers, should clarify immigrant mothers' religious, cultural beliefs and attitudes. Procurement of peer support is important by developing care programs special to immigrant mothers and ensuring immigrant women to come together. Increase in the number of translators in hospitals and preparation of education materials in native language of mothers will improve the level of benefiting from healthcare services.

N2  - This article in the journal "Gruppe. Organisation. Interaktion. (GIO)" portraits a model of organizational acculturation that describes the emergence of acculturative and socialization stressors upon the encounter of different cultures when migrant workers enter organizations, while taking into account the perspective of persons already employed in those organizations. This model combines approaches of acculturation and socialization research. Intrapersonal (cyclic interplay of information, uncertainty reduction and learning) and interpersonal (voice, participation, empowerment and social support) coping-processes lead to successful adaptation of work migrants. In turn, successful adaptation has positive effects on further work-related outcomes. The model takes account of the fact that due to the additional challenge of having to adapt to a new culture, organizational socialization of work migrants proceeds in a more complex fashion. The model provides starting points for future research and practical applications.

N2  - Nigerian women who migrate to the United States are faced with complex social challenges as they acculturate to a new society. Stressful conditions and acculturation experiences may threaten the overall mental health of these immigrant women. The purpose of this study was to explore the acculturation experiences of Nigerian immigrant women living in the United States, identify stressors associated with the process, and highlight the coping strategies they employed. Stress and coping theory provided the theoretical framework for the study and phenomenological inquiry guided the research questions and method. Data were gathered through face-to-face interviews. Content analysis and coding were utilized to find relevant themes. Participants described their immigration experiences as being difficult although they reported their lives are "much better now". The women adopted a positive, hard working attitude; relied on their faith in God; and sought mentors and a supportive community. Most participants reported being unaware of the resources available to them and more than half reported not having access to any resources. Participants reported receiving support from their friends, family members, and communities of faith. Research on the acculturative experiences of these women would be useful in developing gender specific programs that would support the integration process and reduce mental health issues that may arise as a result of acculturation stressors. In an advocacy effort towards social change, results from this study may inform service providers of Nigerian immigrant women's unique cultural needs as they acculturate to living in the United States.

N2  - Interpersonal counseling (IPC), a briefer and simplified adaptation of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), was used with internally displaced women (IDW) in Bogota, Colombia, an implementation study of a mental health care pathway funded by Grand Challenges Canada. Preliminary evidence suggests that IPC led to positive outcomes for IDW and may be a feasible first line treatment for displaced women with elevated symptoms of common mental disorders. The case study demonstrates the use of IPC as an intervention to treat depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms in one participant across 11 sessions, from the case formulation through the termination phase.

N2  - The multidimensional needs of recently resettled refugees have been well documented and range from elevated rates of mental illness and health care challenges to difficulties accessing resources due to language and literacy barriers. These factors are largely responsible for the challenges resettled refugees face in acquiring and maintaining stable employment. It is possible that achieving financial stability through steady employment and purposeful money management may alleviate some stressors associated with the resettlement process, though research in this area that is specific to refugees is in its infancy. What is clear, however, is that a traditional approach to mental health treatment (i.e., therapy in a traditional office setting) may lack effectiveness because of the lack of attention to extraneous stressors such as poverty, transportation, and language and literacy challenges that impact resettled refugees. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively assess the impact of a group-based financial education course and social enterprise on the self-reported mental health (i.e., post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, and somatization) of Bhutanese refugee women resettled in the United States. The study also sought to evaluate the acceptability and overall satisfaction with various components of the intervention. This qualitative study was a follow-up to a larger quantitative study that included 65 Bhutanese women who were resettled to the southwestern United States by a large resettlement agency. The results of this study offer insights into the lived experiences of Bhutanese refugees in the United States, particularly related to cultural integration bolstered by group-based education and shared learning opportunities.

TI  - Entertainment-education and the fotonovela: A new strategy to increase help-seeking behaviors for depression among immigrant Latinas.
AU  - Hernandez, Maria Yesenia
PY  - 2016
PD  - /
N2  - Recent studies find a high risk of depression among immigrant Latinas known to increase during the acculturation process. Several barriers, such as stigma and low health literacy, frequently separate Latinas from treatment. In response this study aimed to replicate the effectiveness of Entertainment-Education (E-E), in the form of a Spanish language fotonovela, in increasing depression literacy among immigrant Latinas at risk for depression. This study specifically sought to assess if exposure to the fotonovela, delivered in a multifaceted approach to health education used by promotoras, improved depression knowledge, the self-efficacy to identify the need for treatment, and the intent to seek treatment while reducing stigma towards depression treatment. Additional exploratory research assessed the participants' response to the fotonovela. Through a mixed methods approach comprised of quantitative data (employing a pretest-posttest randomized control group experimental design) and qualitative data (composed of structured follow- up interviews) 142 immigrant Latinas in a large urban setting were included in this study. Results indicate statistically significant posttest differences in depression knowledge, self-efficacy to identify the need for treatment, and antidepressant stigma between control and experimental group participants. Results also suggest a positive response to the fotonovela reflected in the participants' identification and engagement with the story and its characters. Follow-up interviews detect most participants discussed the content of the fotonovela with friends whom they identified as depressed. Findings suggest use of cost effective E-E health literacy tools, in combination with the multifaceted approach to health education used by promotoras, may increase mental health knowledge and intention to share knowledge among underserved populations. Further mixed methods research is recommended in the continued assessment of mental health literacy among Latinos and development of culturally competent mental health literacy tools.

N2  - This study examined extant scholarship focused on the use of religious coping resources by traumatized African refugees resettled in the United States of America (USA). Most African refugees are from war-torn, natural-disaster-affected, ethnic, religious, and political conflicts ridden countries. Moreover, resettling in the USA equally precipitates traumatic experiences for African refugees. It is therefore not uncommon that African refugees are usually symptomatic of traumatic experiences such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. We systematically searched seven databases using keywords to identify evidence-based religious coping strategies often utilized by traumatized African refugees. The study found that religious activities and membership of religious congregations show marked improvements in overcoming traumatic experiences among African refugees. In addition personalized religious undertakings empowered African refugees to effectively address traumatic reminiscences, and acculturation stressors in the USA. Implications for social work practice, education, and policy as it relates to African refugees are delineated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Little is known about the immigrant Latino/a transgender community in the southeastern United States. This study used photovoice, a methodology aligned with community-based participatory research, to explore needs, assets, and priorities of Latina transgender women in North Carolina. Nine immigrant Latina male-to-female transgender women documented their daily experiences through photography, engaged in empowerment-based photo-discussions, and organized a bilingual community forum to move knowledge to action. From the participants' photographs and words, 11 themes emerged in three domains: daily challenges (e.g., health risks, uncertainty about the future, discrimination, and anxiety about family reactions); needs and priorities (e.g., health and social services, emotional support, and collective action); and community strengths and assets (e.g., supportive individuals and institutions, wisdom through lived experiences, and personal and professional goals). At the community forum, 60 influential advocates, including Latina transgender women, representatives from community-based organizations, health and social service providers, and law enforcement, reviewed findings and identified 10 recommended actions. Overall, photovoice served to obtain rich qualitative insight into the lived experiences of Latina transgender women that was then shared with local leaders and agencies to help address priorities.

N2  - Cumulative exposure to chronic stressors has been shown to contribute to immigrants' deteriorating health with more time in US residence. Few studies, however, have examined links among common psychosocial stressors for immigrants (e.g., acculturation-related) and contexts of immigrant settlement for physical health. The study investigated relationships among social stressors, stress buffers (e.g., family support), and allostatic load (AL)-a summary measure of physiological "wear and tear"-among 126 adult Mexican immigrant farm workers. Analyses examined social contributors to AL in two locales: (1) White, English-speaking majority sites, and (2) a Mexican immigrant enclave. Our six-point AL scale incorporated immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic measures. Among men and women, older age predicted higher AL. Among women, lower family support related to higher AL in White majority communities only. Findings suggest that Latino immigrants' cumulative experiences in the US significantly compromise their health, with important differences by community context.

The authors regret that an error is present in author details for the above published article. The author originally listed as 'Kuo Wei Tay' should be 'Alvin Kuowei Tay'. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2011-07583-018). Australia has been at the forefront of implementing immigration policies that aim to limit the flow of asylum seekers over recent decades. Two controversial polices have been the use of immigration detention for unauthorized arrivals and the issuing of temporary protection visas (TPVs) for refugees who arrived without valid visas. We conducted a longitudinal survey over 2 years commencing in 2003 of 104 consecutive refugees from Iran and Afghanistan attending a state-wide early intervention program in New South Wales. The sample included those released from immigration detention on TPVs (n = 47) and others granted permanent protection visas prior to entering Australia (PPVs, n = 57). Psychological symptoms were assessed at baseline and follow-up by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ), the Hopkins symptom checklist-25 (HSCL), the GHQ-30 and the Penn State Worry Questionnaires (PSWQ). English language competency, daily living difficulties and coping-related activities were also assessed. The results indicated that TPVs had higher baseline scores than PPVs on the HTQPTSD scale, the HSCL scales, and the GHQ. ANCOVA models adjusting for baseline symptom scores indicated an increase in anxiety, depression and overall distress for TPVs whereas PPVs showed improvement over time. PTSD remained high at follow-up for TPVs and low amongst PPVs with no significant change over time. The TPVs showed a significant increase in worry at follow-up. TPVs showed no improvement in their English language skills and became increasingly socially withdrawn whereas PPVs exhibited substantial language improvements and became more socially engaged. TPV holders also reported persistently higher levels of distress in relation to a wide range of post-migration living difficulties whereas PPVs reported few problems in meeting these resettlement challenges. The data suggest a pattern of growing mental distress, ongoing resettlement difficulties, social isolation, and difficulty in the acculturation process amongst refugees subject to restrictive immigration policies.

N2  - Background: This study describes the prevalence of depression symptoms and its impact on health-seeking behaviour among Chinese migrant workers in a sample of 1,533 Shenzhen residents. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was administered in Shenzhen with a random sample of 859 registered and 674 non-registered residents. The 20-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) scale was used to measure depression symptoms. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to assess healthcare services utilisation. Results: Non-registered residents were more likely to have clinically significant depressive symptoms (CES-D score >= 16) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.81; confidence interval (CI) = 1.18, 2.76). Despite this, depressed non-registered residents had no significant difference in health-seeking behaviour when compared to those without depression (OR = 2.86; CI = 0.98, 8.32), while in contrast, depressed registered residents had a positive and stronger association with healthcare services utilisation and/or self-medication (OR = 3.34; CI = 1.28, 8.71). Conclusion: The findings suggest higher prevalence of depression but less utilisation of healthcare services or self-medication among migrant residents. That migrants with depression lack access to healthcare suggests healthcare inequality. Psychological disorders require careful management and treatment; the mismatch in their health needs and access to care may contribute to the Inverse-care law.

N2  - This article describes the findings from a study that examined the psychological ramifications of immigration experiences among Koreans in the United States using hwabyung and depressive symptoms. Data collected from an anonymous survey of 242 voluntary participants were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), and hierarchical multiple regression (R2). The findings demonstrated the statistically significant correlation between hwabyung and depressive symptoms. Also found was the important role of coping resources in explaining both hwabyung and depressive symptoms among Korean immigrants. Additionally, the findings suggest that having a graduate school education in the United Sates, receiving money from Korea, and being a woman were found to be significantly related to hwabyung symptoms. However, no factors related to individual characteristics appeared to have a significant impact on depressive symptoms. Based on the findings, the implications for practice are discussed.

N2  - Being immigrant or living with a person who experiences mental disorders can lead to high levels of emotional problems. The aim of this study is to compare chronic stress in immigrants and relatives. The sample comprised 108 adults (58 immigrants and 50 relatives) who were seeking help due to their emotional problems. In both groups there was an overrepresentation of women. The immigrants were younger; had a lower level of education and higher unemployment rates than the relatives. Both groups showed high levels of symptoms and low self-esteem. The fact that immigrants report similar symptoms to relatives might mean that some of the treatments for relatives, which are well established and effective, could be applied to immigrants.

N2  - Nervios is a culturally defined condition of psychological stress with important implications for Latino health. Using epidemiological research methods, we examined the prevalence of nervios and associated risk factors, including drug and alcohol use, acculturation, and housing conditions in a population-based study of farm worker families in Mendota, CA (the MICASA Study). A household enumeration procedure was used for sampling, and 843 individuals were interviewed in 2006-2007. In this analysis, we present data on 422 men, 381 accompanied (family) males and 41 unaccompanied males. The prevalence of nervios was 22 %, with no difference in prevalence by household status. Low family incomes, drug use, medium/high acculturation, and poor housing conditions were associated with increased odds of nervios. Self-reported poor/fair health, depressive symptoms, and high perceived stress were also associated with nervios. Since nervios has been shown to be a clinical indicator of psychiatric vulnerability among Latinos, this analysis furthers public health goals of reducing health disparities.

N2  - Female domestic workers face many migration-related stressors that affect their mental health, but we know little about the dynamics of stress and coping in different migration phases. This exploratory study aims to assess stress and coping of female migrant domestic workers from the Philippines in different phases of the migration process; prior to migration, in the country of destination and upon return to the Philippines. Data were collected in 2010 using questionnaires (N = 500). Validation of findings took place in a work shop (23 participants) and two focus groups (13 and 8 participants). Stress levels of women were significantly higher abroad than in the Philippines. Stress and coping in the Philippines was primarily related to financial issues, while stress and coping abroad related more strongly loneliness, working conditions and employers. Findings from this study provide insight in the phase-specific and transnational dimensions of stress and coping. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Refugee families often encounter a number of acculturative and resettlement stressors as they make lives for themselves in host countries. These difficulties may be compounded by past trauma and violence exposure, posing increased risk for mental health problems. Greater knowledge is needed about protective processes contributing to positive development and adjustment in refugee families despite risk (e.g., resilience). The aims of this research were to identify and examine strengths and resources utilized by Somali refugee children and families in the Boston area to overcome resettlement and acculturative stressors. We used maximum variation sampling to conduct a total of 9 focus groups: 5 focus groups (total participants N = 30) among Somali refugee adolescents and youth, capturing gender and a range of ages (15 to 25 years), as well as 4 focus groups of Somali refugee mothers and fathers in groups (total participants N = 32) stratified by gender. Drawing from conservation of resources theory (COR), we identified 5 forms of resources comprising individual, family, and collective/community strengths: religious faith, healthy family communication, support networks, and peer support. "Community talk" was identified as a community dynamic having both negative and positive implications for family functioning. Protective resources among Somali refugee children and families can help to offset acculturative and resettlement stressors. Many of these locally occurring protective resources have the potential to be leveraged by family and community-based interventions. These findings are being used to design preventative interventions that build on local strengths among Somali refugees in the Boston area. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study examined how acculturative stress is influenced by social capital, age, income, education and gender in a sample of 326 Iraqi-Christians from southern Ontario, Canada. Both overall acculturative stress and its individual constructs were tested in a series of logistic regression models. Five hypotheses were generated and three layers of analysis were implemented. First, the contributions of social-capital constructs and demographic variables to overall acculturative stress were examined. Second, the same variables were investigated in relation to the individual factors comprising acculturative stress. Third, the relationships of the social capital factors and demographic variables to acculturative stress for males and females were examined separately. This study found that a significant number of Iraqi-Christian immigrants in southern Ontario experience moderate acculturative stressors associated with the experience of discrimination, change in values, language incompetence, feeling unappreciated and discomfort with the loss of their identification with their country of origin. The results offer increased understanding for social workers who work with Iraqi-Christian individuals regarding the experience of acculturation and acculturative stress. Some recommendations for practice emerging from the results were also provided. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Labor migration is thought to have significant mental and physical health impacts, given the risks for exploitation and abuse of migrant workers, particularly among those in semiskilled and unskilled positions, although empirical data are limited. This qualitative study, conducted in July 2010 in Banteay Meanchey Province, Cambodia, focused on psychosocial and mental health signs and symptoms associated with labor migration among Cambodian migrant workers to Thailand. Two qualitative methods identified a number of mental health problems faced by Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand, including the presence of anxiety and depression-like problems among this population, described in local terminology as pibak chet (sadness), keut chreun (thinking too much), and khval khvay khnong chet (worry in heart). Key informants revealed the extent to which psychosocial wellbeing is associated with conditions of poverty, including debt and lack of access to basic services.

N2  - Background: Current knowledge is limited regarding patient characteristics related to treatment outcome of posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in refugees and asylum seekers. Objective: Gender, torture status, offender status, level of anger, and level of depression were investigated for possible effects on the treatment outcome. Method: Patient characteristics were explored in 54 refugees and asylum seekers who had completed a treatment program for PTSD. Non-responders (10), those who had the same or higher levels of symptom severity after treatment, were compared with responders, those who had lower symptom severity after treatment (44). Symptom severity was measured by Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. The non-responders and responders constituted the dichotomous, dependent variable. The independent variables were gender, torture status, offender status, level of anger, and level of depression. T-tests and Exact Unconditional Homogeneity/Independence Tests for 2 x 2 Tables were used to study the relationship to treatment outcome. Results: Being male and reporting to have been a violent offender were significantly more frequent characteristics among the non-responders compared to the responders. The levels of pretreatment anger, depression and torture status did not affect the treatment outcome. Conclusions: The study adds support to findings that females benefit more from treatment of PTSD than males and that violent offenders are difficult to treat within the standard treatment programs.

N2  - Since 1975 approximately three million individuals have been resettled in the USA; this represents an important population to respond to clinically. In order to effectively serve this population, mental health professionals will need to understand the impact of the refugee experience and cultural context on psychological functioning. This chapter will review the unique mental health challenges and culturally adapted assessments and treatments targeting some of the world's most vulnerable, yet resilient, populations. While the nature and location of political conflict around the world will continue to change, the need to welcome to our country those who have been most affected by violence and human rights abuses remains certain. However, reaching a safe refuge from persecution is but the beginning of healing. For those refugees in need of them, effective mental health services can facilitate recovery and successful resettlement, and alter the trajectory of life for generations to come. As the field of refugee research advances, improvements in the clinical assessment and diagnosis of refugees will better enable mental health providers to serve this population. Mental health providers, educators, and policy makers have an increasing opportunity to structure mental health services in ways that meet the complex challenges of refugee mental health. Both organizational and systemic considerations, as well as clinical approaches, can build on recent refugee research to provide a comprehensive, integrated response to refugee mental health needs.

N2  - The treatment of refugees and ethnic minorities presents many challenges. Although they are a very diverse group, many have poor English fluency and minimal education, many have a history of extensive traumas, and many are dealing with several types of stress such as acculturation and living in poor urban areas with high levels of crime. Cultural syndromes, culturally specific catastrophic cognitions, and high rates of comorbidity are often further treatment challenges. There have been some attempts to develop treatments for refugee and ethnic minority populations, particularly for depression, but there has been minimal discussion of how to make cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) culturally appropriate for the treatment of the anxiety disorders. In this chapter we will illustrate how CBT can be adapted to treat ethnic minorities, particularly refugees with anxiety disorders. One of the central assumptions of culturally appropriate treatments is that it is necessary to match the cultural characteristics of the treatment with those of the patients. As the match between the cultural characteristics of the intervention and those of patients increases, so does the effectiveness of the intervention. We will first present a model that describes the cultural influences of anxiety disorders on the generation of anxiety disorders, and based on this model, we then describe various ways to make the treatment culturally appropriate.

N2  - Mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are disproportionately experienced by refugees who have often witnessed traumatic events in the process of fleeing their homelands. For many refugees these problems persist even after they have escaped the threat of persecution and physical harm through resettlement in a host country. The present study examined the effect of a group-based financial education program for Bhutanese refugee women who had been recently resettled in the United States. Participants were divided into three groups, two that were provided a version of the intervention and one that served as a control. Results from pre/post and follow-up assessments indicate that participants in both intervention groups experienced significantly less depression, anxiety, somatization, and PTSD symptoms at posttest and that these improvements in mental health status persisted at 3-month follow-up. Control participants' mental health symptoms became more severe over time. These results suggest that a structured group-based educational intervention can have a positive impact on the mental health of recently resettled refugees. Further, these results provide alarming evidence that without intervention, recently resettled refugees may actually experience declines in mental health status over time in their host country.

PD  - /
N2  - This study examined the effect of self-aware meditation on anxiety and anger in Indian immigrants living in the United States, and compared it with the effect of understanding of the self without meditation. Both treatments were based on the self as defined in the Vedas, the Hindu scriptures. One hundred and thirty-three subjects participated in this study. The subjects were divided randomly into two groups, a Self-aware Meditation group (SM) and a Self-knowledge Theory group (ST). This study was conducted over a long weekend at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, a residential Hindu retreat in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. The meditation group (SM) received 7 hours of guided meditation sessions and the theory group (ST) attended 7 hours of sessions on understanding the self without meditation. The instruments used to measure anxiety were state and trait anxiety from the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). For anger, only trait anger and its two subscales, trait anger-temperament and trait anger-reaction, were applicable, and these were measured using the State and Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAIX-2). All subjects in both groups were pretested on all these measures before the treatments, as well as after the treatments. To examine the differences in subjects after the treatments, the parametric t-test as well as the non-parametric Sign and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests was used. To compare the two groups, the t test and Wilcoxon Ranks Sums tests were used. Pearson's Correlation coefficient ( r) was used to examine the relationship of the demographic variables with pretreatment anxiety and anger in the subjects. Analysis of Variance was used to examine the impact of the demographic variables on the treatment effects. Meditation as well as theory classes, were equally effective in reducing state and trait anxiety as well as in reducing trait anger and trait anger-reaction, but not in reducing trait anger-temperament. The self-understanding classes without meditation were more effective in reducing trait anger-temperament. Age had a small but significant negative correlation with trait anxiety. Education had a small but significant negative correlation with state as well as with trait anxiety. None of the demographic variables had any impact on the treatments.

N2  - This study aims to explore mental health literacy, specifically focusing on depression, among Southeast Asian (SEA) elderly refugees residing in the Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Three focus groups were held with nine mental health professionals who work with SEA elders. Jorm's mental health literacy framework guided the study theoretically. For data analysis, grounded theory was employed by utilizing MAX QDA2. Four themes emerged from the analysis: 1) lack of knowledge about specific mental disorders, 2) culture-specific knowledge and beliefs on the causes of depression, 3) lack of awareness about professional help, and 4) cultural attitudes toward seeking mental health services. The findings indicated that cultural beliefs of SEA elders impact their ability to understand, recognize, and respond to depression. Barriers to treatment were identified and recommendations were made to reduce mental health disparity in this elderly population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Latino immigrants have unique stressors that can influence mental health. The challenges of adapting to a new society include language barriers, separation from family, and feelings of loss, which can lead to depression. Low health literacy may make it difficult to obtain health care services, and depression may then go untreated. This secondary data analysis examined the relationships of immigration demands, health literacy, and depression in a sample of recent Latino immigrants. Depressive symptoms were a significant problem; 26% of the participants reported symptoms that were suggestive of depression. Furthermore, low health literacy and greater immigration demands predicted higher depression scores. The study suggests that recent Latino immigrants would benefit from health literacy training, education on depressive symptoms, and better access to mental health services. Latinos who do access health care services need to be screened for depression; furthermore, home health care nurses can promote access to support and health care services.

N2  - Psychiatrists have long had involvement with the political process, both individually and as a profession. They have made valuable contributions to debate over such issues as war, conflict, terrorism, torture, human rights abuse, drug abuse, suicide and other public health issues. However, they have also been complicit in some gross atrocities. Over several years there has been debate over the Australian Government's treatment of asylum seekers, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists took the unusual step of publicly criticizing the Australian Government's policy on grounds of its toxicity leading to a diagnosis of collective depression syndrome, particularly among child detainees, but also adult detainees. The official Ministerial response was to deny that collective depression exists and to assert that the concept is meaningless. Can this intervention by psychiatrists be interpreted as a product of earlier political behaviors by psychiatrists? The willingness of psychiatrists to cooperate with other professions, notably psychologists, pediatricians, physicians and lawyers, is noted, as is presence of minority voices within the Australian psychiatric profession. The significance of the debate over the mental condition of asylum-seeking detainees is that its outcome has implications for how Australia sees itself and is seen by the rest of the world, that is, its national identity.

The members were all survivors of the Khmer Rouge from the 1970s and 80s and had current diagnoses of post traumatic stress disorder. The group consisted of 16 women aged 44-60. The members describe their trans-cultural experiences of ageing within the United States. The paper also describes a therapy team approach which uses an English speaking licensed professional and a Khmer speaking paraprofessional. The strengths and challenges of this approach are discussed. Agencies that serve refugees may not have professionally trained mental health providers who are from the country of origin of their clients. This model holds promise to provide culturally sensitive treatment. However, it is a model that is in its infancy in terms of knowing what works and how to duplicate that to other agencies and populations. This paper shares some of the benefits as well as some of the drawbacks. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Literature has shown that Korean immigrants experience severe depressive symptoms due to the stresses associated with immigration. The purpose of this study is to extend current research on stress and depression to the Korean immigrant population in the United States. While most studies on Korean immigrants focus almost entirely on the unsettling nature of immigration, the current study focused on the role of stress-resistance variables (mediating factors) in the relationship between various sources of stress and depression among Korean immigrants. This study investigated the relationship between stressors and depression and the effects of such mediating variables as coping strategies, social support, personal resources (mastery and self-esteem), and religiosity on the stressors-depression relationship among the Korean population. The sample of this study consisted of 374 Korean immigrants who migrated to the United States at the age of 16 or older. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the study hypotheses. Results found detrimental effects of stressors on the level of depression, as well as mediating effects of perceived social support and personal resources (self-esteem and mastery) on the relationship between stressors and depression. However, no mediating effects of coping strategies and religiosity on the relationship between stressors and depression were found. Implications for social work practice, research, theory, policy, and education are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This article reviews the experience of a unique occupational group of World Trade Center (WTC) workers: immigrant workers. This group is comprised largely of men, laborers, who are first-generation immigrants. The majority of these workers are from Latin America (predominantly from Ecuador and Colombia) or from Eastern Europe (predominantly from Poland). Our data shows that the disease profile observed in these workers was what we have previously reported for WTC working population as a whole. Recent reports have begun to document the disproportionate burden of occupational hazards, injuries, and illnesses experienced by immigrant workers in the United States. The WTC experience of immigrants exemplified this burden but, additionally, highlighted that this burden is exacerbated by limitations in access to appropriate health care, disability and compensation benefits, and vocational rehabilitation services. A clinical program that was designed to address the complex medical and psychosocial needs of these workers in a comprehensive manner was successfully established. Full justice for these workers depends on larger societal changes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Traumatic stress due to conflict and war causes major mental health problems in many resource-poor countries. The objective of this study was to examine whether trained lay counselors can carry out effective treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a refugee settlement. In a randomized controlled dissemination trial in Uganda with 277 Rwandan and Somalian refugees who were diagnosed with PTSD the authors investigated the effectiveness of psychotherapy administered by lay counselors. Strictly manualized narrative exposure therapy (NET) was compared with more flexible trauma counseling (TC) and a no-treatment monitoring group (MG). Fewer participants (4%) dropped out of NET treatment than TC (21%). Both active treatment groups were statistically and clinically superior to MG on PTSD symptoms and physical health but did not differ from each other. At follow-up, a PTSD diagnosis could not be established anymore in 70% of NET and 65% TC participants, whereas only 37% in MG did not meet PTSD criteria anymore. Short-term psychotherapy carried out by lay counselors with limited training can be effective to treat war-related PTSD in a refugee settlement.

N2  - The present study examined the efficacy of two parent training programs in reducing perceived parental stress in a sample of Spanish speaking migrant farmworkers of Hispanic origin. Sixty-eight Spanish-speaking mothers, referred for parenting classes because one of their children was experiencing behavioral or emotional difficulties, were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions: (1) 1-2-3 Magic, a behaviorally-based program; (2) Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (STEP), an Adlerian-based program; (3) attention-placebo condition; and, (4) wait-list control group. All treatment conditions were presented in Spanish, and offered at convenient times and locations for participants. Parental stress was measured with the Spanish version of the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF), using the Total Stress Score, and the three subscale scores: Parental Distress Score, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction Score, and Difficult Child Score. Assessments were completed at pretest, posttest, and at a three-month follow-up. A repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance on the dependent measures revealed significant differences for groups across the three assessment periods. Subsequent analyses indicated that the behaviorally-based program produced significantly greater reductions on the Total Stress Score and Parental Distress Score at posttest and follow-up than the Adlerian program, the attention-placebo group, and the wait-list group. The behaviorally-based program was also more effective in reducing parent-child dysfunctional interaction than the attention-placebo group at posttest and follow-up, and the wait-list control group at follow-up, but not in comparison to the Adlerian program. These results lend support for behaviorally-based parent training in reducing perceived parental stress in this migrant farmworker population. To ensure treatment integrity, a parent trainer validity check was used in which expert parent educators rated randomly selected videotaped segments of each parent training session on five criteria. Statistical analysis of treatment validity revealed no significant differences in mean scores of expert raters across parenting groups, suggesting that the parent trainer behaved consistently on the criteria across all treatment conditions. The results are also discussed in relation to the literature on parent training. In addition, the limitations of the present study, as well as future directions for research are discussed.

N2  - The study aimed to examine the differences in caregiving context and psychological distress outcome between non-immigrant and immigrant caregivers; to investigate these differences by relationship type; and to examine the factors related to psychological distress. Spouse or adult child caregivers (213 non-immigrants and 206 immigrants from the Former Soviet Union) were interviewed. Based on stress and appraisal conceptual framework, caregiving stressors, primary appraisal, psychosocial resources, secondary appraisal and psychological distress were measured. A series of two-way MANOVA, followed by ANOVA, was used to examine the differences by immigration status, by relationship type and their interaction. Hierarchical multiple linear regression was conducted to examine variables associated with psychological distress. Negligible differences in caregiving stressors, but significant differences in caregiving primary and secondary appraisal, psychosocial resources and psychological distress were found by immigration status and by relationship type, and significant interactions only in caregiving primary appraisal. The regression models showed that the differences in psychological distress by immigration status and by relationship type were fully explained by caregiving stressors (care recipient's problem behavior), psychosocial resources (mastery) and caregiving secondary appraisal (role overload, captivity, economic difficulties). The results suggest that socio-cultural background and role relationship shape caregiving appraisal and psychosocial resources, and that these factors explain psychological distress outcomes.

N2  - Refugee and immigrant women may face a variety of pre- and post-migration stressors that make them susceptible to mental health disorders and adjustment problems. Recommendations on how to effectively provide mental health services to this population, based on a mental health program developed to meet the specific needs of refugee and immigrant women in a Midwestern city, are provided. This specific program offers a holistic approach, including counseling, home visits, psycho-educational workshops, and support and advocacy from other refugee and immigrant women. A case study is included to illustrate how this program functions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Over 15825 Kosovar refugees have entered the United States since 1999. Few studies have investigated the extent to which psychological trauma has led to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population. Using standardized instruments, we conducted a caseworker-assisted survey of 129 Kosovars (aged 18 to 79, 55% male) settled in the states of Michigan and Washington. In this sample, 78 cases (60.5%) exceeded the recommended cutoff with a high criterion indicating the likely presence of PTSD and 83 cases (64.3%) exceeded the cutoff indicating the likely presence of depressive disorder. The mean (SD) of war-related traumatic events reported was 14.98 (4.48), and all but 10 cases (92.2%) had a trauma score greater than 10. Higher PTSD scores were associated with female gender, older age, more traumatic events, and more depressive symptoms. Women refugees had higher levels of PTSD severity scores and more depressive disorders. Multivariate analysis shows that positive predictors for PTSD severity scores and depressive disorders were female gender, number of traumatic events, and a prior occupation that required more education. Lower PTSD severity scores were related to a gender/number of traumatic events interaction factor. Also investigated were the use of religious/spiritual coping and its impact on positive attitudes among these refugees of the Kosovar war. We collected information about religiosity, war-related trauma, religious/spiritual coping, optimism, and hope. A path model demonstrated that optimism was positively related to positive coping, which in turn was associated with increased religiosity and higher education. Hope, in contrast, was positively associated with education, and negatively associated with negative coping, which in turn was predicted by more severe trauma. These findings are discussed with respect to its theoretical and clinical implications as well as the limitations of the study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The purpose of this project is to restore the church members at Pyung Ahn Church through healing the depression. The immigrants are suffering from various cultural and linguistic barriers in their daily lives, which brings the depression. The researcher has worked as an immigrant pastor at Pyung Ahn Church in Toronto, Canada for 13 years. He realized that some of the members at Pyung Ahn Church are suffering from the depression and the faith of them is not growing much due to the depression. He established five hypotheses in this project: The relationship with God would be restored. The members would find self-identity and vision for their lives. They would have a new perspective on their family relationship. They would be more active in their church lives. Finally, they would establish a healthy relationship with their neighbors and the friends in their offices. The hypotheses were supported. The participants showed great understanding on depression. They experienced the healing on their depression directly or indirectly. Through the right understanding on depression, they could establish the healthy relationship with their family members and neighbors. Also they showed the growth in their faith. Some of them are helping their pastors in caring the wounded members in the church. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The possible protective effect of family and activity (including work and employment training) on posttraumatic reactions in traumatized refugees living in a host society was explored. A total of 966 refugees participated in the study, the majority of whom had been exposed to war and/or torture trauma prior to arrival in Norway. The study sample consisted of two groups: one had been referred to a psychiatric outpatient clinic for evaluation or treatment, the other consisted of refugees interviewed in connection with a health examination upon arrival in the municipalities to which they were allocated. The study showed that presence of family and employment/training had positive effects on posttraumatic symptoms regardless of level of traumatic exposure. But the results also showed that the higher the level of exposure to traumatic events, the stronger the effect of family (spouse and/or children) seemed to be. The study illustrates the importance of implementing psychosocial measures with special emphasis on activity and strengthening of family systems, in the integration of traumatized refugees in a host community.

N2  - The present study explores whether the refugee woman's sense of social isolation decreased after participating in a psychosocial group. It also assesses the participants' levels of depression and the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, (PTSD). The study participants were women referred to a mental health center in the Midwest. Nine Bosnian refugee women ranging in age from 45 to 59 participated in the study. Group sessions were held biweekly for a six-week period. All of the group participants, prior to participating in the study, were diagnosed with depression, PTSD, or another mood disorder. Pre-and posttests of the UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale-Interview (PSS-I) were administered. The posttest scores on the loneliness scale and the total score on the PSS-I were lower on the posttest than on the pretest. The PSS-I subscales of arousal and avoidance were also lower on the posttest than on the pretest. The pre- and posttest scores on the BDI did not change. Each participant also completed a nine-item postgroup questionnaire. The majority of the group participants stated that they made new friends and enjoyed the group outings. The Bosnian women's group quickly developed a sense of cohesion. The group members maintained contact with one another outside of the group and became acquainted with each other's extended family. A developing sense of empowerment was evidenced by the group members' ability to demand that the group continue after the study was completed.

N2  - This study examined the relationship between acculturation, acculturative stress and self-worth, as well as level of education and age of entry. There were a total of 124 subjects. The participants were first-generation Armenian Immigrant adults between the ages of 21 and 45 years. There were 66 women and 58 men. The sample included 58 Iranian Armenians, 63 Armenians from Armenia, and 3 Russian Armenians. The participants were recruited randomly from various Armenian Organizations and various Armenian businesses. There were four instruments used to collect data: The demographic questionnaire, used for gathering background information; the Armenian Cultural Life Style Inventory, used to measure level of acculturation as well as identifying acculturation strategies; the Kerendi-Kadkhoda acculturative Stress Scale, used to measure immersion-based and resistance-based acculturative stress; and the Adult Self-Perception Profile, used to measure perceived sociability and perceived intelligence. The Pearson's product moment and Spearman's rho correlations were used to measure the relationship between variables. The independent sample T-test statistical measure was used to compare means between the variables. Several hypotheses were found to be significant. First, contrary to the proposed hypotheses, the results showed that those with elevated levels of cultural shift had elevated levels of perceived sociability and higher levels of perceived intelligence. The results also indicated that those choosing cultural incorporation had lower resistance-based acculturative stress than those choosing cultural resistance. In addition, contrary to the proposed hypothesis, it was shown that those choosing cultural resistance had lower levels of perceived intelligence than those choosing cultural shift. Furthermore, it was shown that those experiencing higher immersion-based acculturative stress had lower levels of perceived sociability. In addition, the findings showed that those with higher education had higher levels of perceived intelligence. Finally, the results indicated that those entering the U.S. later in life experienced higher levels of resistance-based acculturative stress, while reported lower levels of perceived sociability. The overall results were somewhat consistent with past research with other immigrant populations. Future research should explore the relationship between acculturation and other variables associated with psychological well-being. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - One problem of substantial importance in the multicultural Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is meeting the needs of new immigrants. Immigrant parents seeking mental health care for their children face many barriers, with the result that many do not receive necessary services. Parents may also either misinterpret their children's psychological distress or fear the stigma of receiving mental health care. The LAUSD Mental Health Services Unit wanted to develop and rigorously evaluate a mental health program that could be disseminated across the district if effective. To guide a collaborative relationship, the Mental Health Services Unit and clinician/researchers chose to work together in the context of a participatory research partnership. This partnership created the Mental Health for Immigrants Program (MHIP), with the school district serving as the senior partner, identifying both the problem (psychological sequelae of violence exposure) and the desired intervention setting (school-based mental health services). The academic partners assisted in the development of the clinical intervention and in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The study examined the role of cultural orientation and coping style as predictors of psychological symptomatology among Iranian female immigrants. The sample included 133 Iranian women ranging in age from 17 to 69, residing in the greater Los Angeles area. Subjects completed questionnaires in either English or Farsi. Overall (i.e. global) symptomatology, as well as 9 subtypes of psychopathology were examined. These included depression, anxiety, somatization, obsessive-compulsiveness, paranoia, psychoticism, phobic anxiety, hostility, and interpersonal sensitivity. The study utilized both univariate and multivariate analyses. In the multivariate analyses, the effect of significant demographics were controlled for. The findings indicated that biculturality was related to the best mental health outcomes Assimilation into the host culture was also related to better mental health outcomes but this extended to fewer symptom dimensions. Alienation, whereby the immigrant was not connected to either the home or host culture, was consistently related to worse mental health outcomes. In the realm of coping, planful problem solving was related to better outcomes on all measures of symptomatology. Conversely, escape/avoidance was related to worse outcomes on all measures of symptomatology. It appeared that active, problem focused coping strategies were superior to passive, emotion focused ones. Both coping style and cultural orientation were also found to be distributed along demographic lines. Women displayed different cultural orientations and coping styles depending on their age, education, income, and marital status. The stressful aspects of immigration, as well as its connection to mental health are discussed, as is the social-cultural background of Iranians particularly as it relates to gender roles and symptomatology. Clinical implications and suggestions for intervention and prevention work with immigrants are also presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

Cluster analysis identified 2 groups with particularly good levels of mental health: single well-educated women migrating in a spirit of adventure, and women with many years of successful service as domestic helpers in Hong Kong. Two groups had particularly poor mental health: those experiencing abuse by employers, and those with both debt and family problems in The Philippines. Despite stresses surrounding the migration experience, the Filipino community in Hong Kong has developed a strong network of group resources which offer formal and informal counselling, and negotiation for better labour conditions.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) Bicultural Effectiveness Training Group (BET); (b) Support Group (SG); and (c) Wait-list control (WLC). BET is a highly structured psychoeducational treatment modality designed to increase levels of biculturalism and reduce the stresses of acculturation. The support group lacked the psychoeducational components of the BET. Additionally, the support group's main objective was to encourage support among group members. Treatment outcome was measured by examining changes in the pre- and post testing in depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, immigrant stress, and levels of biculturalism. Results from this study revealed that subjects participating in the BET modality experienced less depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, and immigrant stress at posttest than at pretest. BET was more effective in reducing depression at posttest than the SG or the WLC group. No differences between BET and SG were found in measures of anxiety, psychosomatization, and immigrant stress. Compared to WLC group BET was also more effective in decreasing immigrant stress at posttest. In reference to levels of biculturalism and cultural involvement, BET was more effective in increasing cultural involvement than SG and WLC group and enhancing levels of biculturalism in comparison to WLC group. It was concluded that BET is an effective treatment modality for recent Mexican and Central American women immigrants experiencing acculturative stress and other psychological symptoms. This research provides knowledge that will allow service providers to address relevant issues for Hispanic immigrants. The following recommendations were the outcome of this investigation and seem to be key elem (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Examined psychological distress in 233 female and 152 male Soviet immigrant physicians in Israel and investigated risk and resilience factors in the psychological adjustment to immigration. Ss were participants in preparatory licensing courses. They completed the study questionnaire during the 4th and 5th wks of the course. Measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory. Family problems were found to be significantly correlated with depression: The highest rate of reported depression was found among single parents. Ss examined during the 2nd yr after immigration reported depression more often than Ss who were in Israel less than a year. Findings suggest that motivational and family factors may enhance or mitigate the psychological distress experienced by immigrants. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study was conducted with 62 Mexican-American migrant farm workers at four different sites in northern Illinois. An established English and a newly developed pilot Spanish version of the health-promoting lifestyle profile was used. The concept of health-promoting lifestyle appeared to be culturally relevant to study participants. English-speaking migrant workers scored significantly lower than Spanish-speaking workers on the dimensions of self-actualization, exercise, and stress management. Patterns of scores among both groups were highest in self-actualization and interpersonal support, and lowest in health responsibility and exercise. Further research in health-promoting behaviors with all cultural groups and socioeconomic levels of society will contribute to achievement of the World Health Organization's goal, health for all by the year 2000.

Data suggest that families most at risk for experiencing difficulties in relocating are those moving a distance of more than 150 mi and those in which the employee's spouse will need to look for employment in the new location and the children will need to be placed in a new school. Social support and property issues were factors accounting for nearly half of the variance in reported stress scores. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Discusses mental health and mental illness of migrant laborers in Western Europe in the context of their social background, current developments, and the global processes they are involved in. Rates of mental illness among migrants were lower than predicted on the basis of the severity of the stress they faced. Two facts were singled out as central aspects of the laborers' capacity to cope with the stress due to migration. The main theories about migration were critically reviewed. It is suggested that peasants' strategies of survival in hostile environments underlie the explanations of the unexpected lower rate of mental illness. Phenomena of mental disturbances specific to the group are described and related to social and historical perspectives. (64 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Recent Latina immigrants are at increased risk of poor mental health due to stressors associated with adapting to life in the United States. Existing social and health care policies often do not adequately address the mental health concerns of new Latino populations. Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma, a community-partnered research project, seeks to improve immigrant Latinas’ mental health outcomes. Using Photovoice methodology, promotoras (lay health advisors) reflected on community factors affecting mental health through photography and guided discussion. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using content analysis to identify salient themes. Promotoras reviewed codes to develop themes that they presented in community forums to reach local policy makers and to increase community awareness. These forums included an exhibit of the promotoras’ photographs and discussion of action steps to address community concerns. Themes included transitioning to life in the United States, parenting, education, and combating racism. Nearly 150 stakeholders attended the community forums and proposed responses to promotoras’ photographic themes. Our findings suggest that Photovoice provides an opportunity for Latinas and the larger community to identify issues that they find most important and to explore avenues for action and change by creating sustainable partnerships between the community and forum attendees.

N2  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) disproportionately affects immigrant women, an understudied and underserved population in need for evidence-based rigorously evaluated culturally competent interventions that can effectively address their health and safety needs.Methods: This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to rigorously evaluate an adaptive, trauma-informed, culturally tailored technology-delivered intervention tailored to the needs of immigrant women who have experienced IPV. In the first stage randomization, participants are randomly assigned to an online safety decision and planning or a usual care control arm and safety, mental health and empowerment outcomes are assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-baseline. For the second stage randomization, women who do not report significant improvements in safety (i.e., reduction in IPV) and empowerment from baseline to 3 months follow up (i.e., non-responders) are re- randomized to safety and empowerment strategies delivered via text only or a combination of text and phone calls with trained advocates. Data on outcomes (safety, mental health, and empowerment) for early non-responders is assessed at 6 and 12 months post re-randomization.Discussion: The study's SMART design provides an opportunity to implement and evaluate an individualized intervention protocol for immigrant women based on their response to type or intensity of intervention. The findings will be useful for identifying what works for whom and characteristics of participants needing a particular type or intensity level of intervention for improved outcomes. If found to be effective, the study will result in an evidence-based trauma-informed culturally tailored technology-based safety decision and planning intervention for immigrant survivors of IPV that can be implemented by practitioners serving immigrant women in diverse settings.Trial Registration: This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04098276 on September 13, 2019.

N2  - Use of mental health care services for psychological distress is limited among Latino immigrants. In geographic areas where migration has been rapid, mental health systems possess limited capacity to provide bilingual and bicultural assistance. The development of a bilingual and bicultural workforce is a necessary yet long-term solution. More immediate strategies, however, are needed to meet the needs of immigrant Latinos. This paper describes the development of a stress-reduction focused, lay health advisor training that targets individual behavior change among Latina immigrants. The theoretical foundation, curriculum components, and pilot implementation of the training are discussed. As natural leaders, Latina promotoras disseminated learned strategies and resources within their communities. The lay health advisor model is a salient method for disseminating information regarding mental health and stress reduction among Latinas.

N2  - Despite the high health and mental health care needs, resettled refugees often face cultural and linguistic challenges that hinder the access to appropriate and timely interventions and services. Additionally, such concepts as preventive health or mental health treatment are foreign to this population, which creates additional burdens to the refugee community that already have difficulty navigating a complex health care system in the U.S. To address multiple and complex gaps in health and mental health support for the refugee community, requested is an innovative approach that can convey culturally responsive and effective interventions for health promotion, such as peer-based health education. Few studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of peer-led community health interventions with refugee populations in the U.S. resettlement context. However, peer-led interventions have been shown to be effective when working with cultural minorities and interventions in an international context. Adopting a social capital framework, the current study conducted qualitative evaluation on the impact of a pilot peer-led community health workshop (CHW) in the Bhutanese refugee community. A hybrid thematic analysis of focus group discussion data revealed the improvement in health promotion outcomes and health practice, as well as perceived emotional health. The results also showed that the peer-led CHW provided a platform of community building and participation, while increasing a sense of community, sense of belonging and unity. The findings posit that a peer-led intervention model provides culturally responsive and effective tools for building social capital and promoting community health in the refugee community.

N2  - Poor mental health remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the Bhutanese refugee community. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a promising intervention that has been used in other immigrant communities to prepare individuals to recognize and respond to mental health warning signs. This was a non-randomized program evaluation. Using pre- and post-training questionnaires developed for prior evaluations of MHFA, we examined the effectiveness of training offered with and without culturally-appropriate orientation to mental health terminology and concepts (N = 458). Pre- to post-training improvement in ability to recognize schizophrenia, ability to respond to schizophrenia and depression, and the overall mental health literacy was greater for Bhutanese refugees who attended orientation relative to other participants (P < 0.05). In scaling up MHFA training for other immigrant communities, we recommend developing and systematically evaluating culturally-appropriate orientation materials that introduce mental health vocabulary and contextualize mental health concepts.

N2  - Objective: Gaining understanding of the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of family caregivers of people with dementia with Turkish or Moroccan immigrant backgrounds and to examine whether an educational peer group intervention can improve HRQL.Methods: Understanding of HRQL and associated variables was obtained by multiple linear regression analyses. The effects of the intervention on HRQL were assessed in multilevel analyses using data collected before the start (baseline), directly after the intervention (one to two weeks after baseline) and three months after the start of the intervention. The intervention (two interactive group sessions) entailed providing information about dementia and care/support options.Results: At baseline (n = 319), HRQL was moderately and significantly associated with migration background, gender, self-perceived pressure from informal care and the formal and informal support received (p < .05). The intervention had a small effect on emotional wellbeing directly after the intervention (p < .05) and on perceived general health status three months after (p < .05).Conclusion: Culturally sensitive peer group education on dementia and care/support options can to some extent enhance HRQL among family caregivers in the short term.Practice Implications: The intervention as described in this study is recommended for supporting family caregivers of people with dementia with Turkish or Moroccan backgrounds.

N2  - A broad-based needs assessment of a migrant farmworker community was conducted using the community functional health pattern tool (Gikow & Kucharski, 1987) and Porter's (1987) factor-isolating theory of population group diagnosis. Data analysis revealed numerous health needs in all 10 functional health patterns and an urgent need for accessible primary prevention programs. A mobile outreach program to the migrant camps was seen as the most effective way to provide education, screening, and health care.

N2  - Access to higher education as well as obtaining an academic degree is burdensome for Syrian refugees and socially disadvantaged Jordanians. The two social groups also show an increased vulnerability to mental disorders. The present study evaluates if the provided psychosocial support is socially and emotionally helpful for 75 students (35 Syrian refugees; 40 socially disadvantaged Jordanians) in a scholarship programme for Masters studies in Jordan. Both social groups were expected to report vulnerability to depression and anxiety. Females were assumed to be more vulnerable. Psychosocial support measures were presumed to be evaluated positively. Females were expected to evaluate academic support more positively than males, whereas Syrians were anticipated to perceive the social support more positively than Jordanians. A total of 21 Syrian and 22 Jordanian scholarship holders filled out a questionnaire for assessing their levels of depression and anxiety, ratings of the provided psychosocial support measures and perceived social support by staff of the scholarship programme. Quantitative data analysis confirmed the provided psychosocial support to be helpful. Psychosocial support is socially and emotionally helpful for Masters students of the given groups. Differences in gender and nationality should be considered, when designing psychosocial support measures.

N2  - Later-life immigration and a lack of dominant language competency present many challenges to mental health for older adults. English as a Second Language (ESL) classes for seniors, often regarded as the sole domain of ESL teachers, offer mental health professionals opportunities for mental health promotion and education. This paper examines some of the mental health issues that emerged from stories written by older adults in an ESL for Seniors program. The program is presented as an example of best practices in an ESL for Seniors program because of its specific development to meet the needs of ESL older persons.

N2  - Background: Research increasingly highlight post-migration factors for migrants' mental health status. We investigated the association between participation in a health promotion program and changes in migrants' mental health, and if socio-demographic factors and length of time in the new home country, Sweden, influenced a potential association.Methods: A five-week health promotion program named 'Hälsostöd' [Health Support], led by community health workers, was offered to migrants, primarily asylum seekers and newly arrived immigrants (N = 202). The framework for the program was salutogenic psycho-education, which focused on health effects of migration experiences, lifestyle and health, and the health care system. Mental health was measured at the start and end of the program. We analysed this follow up by using the recommended clinical cut off (i.e. > 11 of maximum 36, with higher scores indicating possible mental illness) in the 12- item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12). Chi Square test was used to analyse statistical significance of changes, and multinomial logistic regression to analyse associations to sociodemographic factors and length of stay in Sweden.Results: The number of participants scoring above the clinical cut off after participation in the program (N = 79, 39.1%) was lower compared to the corresponding number before participation (N = 111, 55.0%), Chi Square = 10.17, p < .001. The majority of the participants had no change 72.3 (N = 146), 21.8% (N = 44) had a positive change, yet 5.9% (N = 12) had a negative change, compared to before participation in the program. None of the investigated sociodemographic factors showed to significantly influence the association. Length of stay in Sweden was trending, with participants with longer stay being more likely to have possible mental illness.Conclusion: We conclude that psycho-educative programs, similar to 'Hälsostöd', have potential for promoting asylum seekers' and newly arrived immigrants' mental health as the evaluation showed a considerable number of positive changes in participants. The result suggests the importance of offering immigrants health promotive programs in close connection with arrival to the new home country. Future research should clarify under what circumstances sociodemographic factors influence the effects of such programs.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Older immigrants from non-industrialised countries are a growing group, they have comparatively many health problems and are often hard to reach through health promotion and other preventive services. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a short health education and physical exercise programme on the health and the physical activity of Turkish first generation elderly immigrants. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Welfare services in six Dutch cities. PARTICIPANTS: 126 people born in Turkey and aged 45 years and over, of whom 92 completed the trial. INTERVENTION: Eight, two hour sessions consisting of health education and exercises. Topics in health education focused on means to maintain a good health. Education was adapted to the culture and knowledge of older Turks and offered by a Turkish peer educator, in Turkish. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical and mental wellbeing, and mental health based on the SF-12/36; knowledge on health and disease; physical activity. RESULTS: Participants were highly disadvantaged; 52% had not completed primary school and 49% had considerable problems in speaking Dutch. Participants in the intervention group showed an improvement in mental health (effect size: 0.38 SD (95% confidence intervals 0.03 to 0.73), p=0.03); the oldest subgroup also in mental wellbeing (effect size 0.75 SD (0.22 to 1.28), p=0.01). No improvements were seen in physical wellbeing and activity, nor in knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Health education and physical exercise improve the mental state of deprived immigrants. Painstaking cultural adaptations to contents and method of delivery are essential to reach this effect.

PY  - 2016
PD  - 07//
N2  - The aim of this paper is to examine the psychosocial needs and stressors among refugees of conflicts within developing countries, and their group based, social support mechanisms. Systematic literature searches of peer reviewed journal articles (n = 60 articles) were carried out using the following factors: type (refugee) ; cause (conficts) ; location (developing countries). As refugees move towards a prolonged urban displacement phase, needs and stressors became different than those of the acute phase. While daily stressors affect far more people than posttraumatic stress disorder, many psychosocial support interventions focus only on the latter. Positive effects of social support on the mental health of displaced people have been established, while the process is not yet clear, group processes and identities appear to be important. The authors suggest, therefore, that a social identity approach can be applied to understand the emergence of a common refugee identity, and its role in empowerment through activating social support networks.El objetivo de este artículo es examinar las necesidades psicosociales y factores generadores de estrés entre los refugiados de los conflictos en países en desarrollo y sus mecanismos de apoyo social basados en trabajos en grupos. Una revisión sistemática de la literatura encontrada sobre el tema en términos de artículos encontrados (n = 60 artículos) se llevó a cabo utilizando los siguientes factores: tipo (refugiados); causa (conflictos); ubicación (países en desarrollo). A medida que los refugiados transitan hacia una fase de desplazamiento urbano prolongado las necesidades y los factores de estrés son distintos a aquellos que se presentan durante la fase de crisis aguda. Mientras que los factores de estrés diarios afectan a un número significativamente más alto de personas que el trastorno de estrés postraumático, muchas intervenciones de apoyo psicosocial se centran sólo en este último. Se han establecido los efectos positivos del apoyo social en la salud mental de las personas desplazadas. Aunque el proceso aún no se ha esclarecido, los procesos e identidades grupales parecen ser de suma importancia. Los autores sugieren, por lo tanto, que un enfoque desde la identidad social se puede aplicar para entender el surgimiento de una identidad común de refugiados, y su papel en el empoderamiento a través de la activación de redes de apoyo social.Le but de cet article est d’examiner les besoins et facteurs de stress psychosociaux chez les réfugiés fuyant les zones de conflit dans les pays en développement ainsi que les mécanismes de soutien social au sein du groupe. Dans ce but, une recherche documentaire systématique dans des publications scientifiques évaluées par des pairs (n = 60 articles) a été effectuée sur la base des critères suivants : type (réfugié) ; cause (conflits); localisation (pays en développement). Lorsque les réfugiés se retrouvent en phase de déplacement prolongé en zone urbaine, les besoins et les facteurs de stress se modifient par rapport à ceux qui prévalent pendant la phase d’accueil urgent. Alors que les stresseurs quotidiens affectent beaucoup plus de personnes que le syndrome de stress post-traumatique, un grand nombre d’interventions de soutien psychologique ne concentrent uniquement sur ce dernier (SSPT). Les effets positifs d’un soutien social sur la santé mentale des personnes déplacées ont été démontrés, même si le processus n’est pas encore tout à fait compris, il semble que les repères identitaires au sein du groupe jouent un rôle important. Par conséquent, les auteurs suggèrent le recours à une approche axée sur l’identité sociale pour comprendre l’émergence d’une identité commune de réfugié et de son rôle dans l’appropriation en activant des réseaux de soutien social.

N2  - The current study explores the level and social determinants of resilience among Syrian refugees residing in Jordan. Having high levels of resilience can help refugees positively adapt to challenges and cope with the burden of stressors associated with warfare, turmoil, and displacement. A sample of 151 Syrian refugees ages 18 to 69 residing in Jordan completed the Arabic version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Resilience scores among Syrian refugees in Jordan were generally low. Refugees' place of residence, educational level, employment status, and monthly income were significantly associated with lower resilience scores and together explain approximately 37% of variance in resilience scores. Tailored resilience-building and educational programs are needed to help Syrian refugees develop the ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from stress and adversity, and maintain or return to healthy mental states. Future research involving longitudinal assessment of resilience is needed to fully understand the role and determinants of resilience in this population.

N2  - Community-based participatory research methodology is driven by community interests and rooted in community involvement throughout the research process. This article describes the use of community-based participatory research methodology in the HEAAL project (Health and Mental Health Education and Awareness for Africans in Lowell), a research collaboration between Christ Jubilee International Ministries--a nondenominational Christian church in Lowell, Massachusetts, that serves an African immigrant and refugee congregation--and the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Psychiatry. The objective of the HEAAL project was to better understand the nature, characteristics, scope, and magnitude of health and mental health issues in this faith community. The experience of using community-based participatory research in the HEAAL project has implications for research practice and policy as it ensured that research questions were relevant and meaningful to the community; facilitated successful recruitment and navigation through challenges; and can expedite the translation of data to practice and improved care.

N2  - Resettled refugees from Muslim-majority countries are underrepresented in research and meeting their mental health needs remains a challenge for countries of resettlement. In this integrative review, we synthesize community-based mental health interventions using an ecological framework. Eleven relevant studies were identified using PubMed and PsychInfo database. Most interventions focus on micro-system level factors like promoting integration and social connections suggest improvement of outcomes including depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. Studies suggest how mental health programs addressing psychosocial wellbeing improves outcomes across ecological levels through: (1) early screening upon resettlement; (2) education and raising awareness of mental health; and (3) engagement of refugees in local community social support systems. Largely qualitative studies suggest benefits of engagement and education program for refugees, but there is a need for high quality, rigorous mental health intervention studies with resettled refugees with explicit attention to equitable and collaborative partnerships across multiple sectors in the community.

N2  - Background: In asylum seekers and refugees, the frequency of mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, is higher than the general population, but there is a lack of data on risk factors for the development of mental disorders in this population. Aim: This study investigated the risk factors for mental disorder development in a large group of asylum seekers and refugees resettled in high- and middle-income settings. Methods: Participant-level data from two randomized prevention studies involving asylum seekers and refugees resettled in Western European countries and in Turkey were pooled. The two studies randomized participants with psychological distress, but without a diagnosis of mental disorder, to the Self-Help Plus psychological intervention or enhanced care as usual. At baseline, exposure to potentially traumatic events was measured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire-part I, while psychological distress and depressive symptoms were assessed with the General Health Questionnaire and the Patient Health Questionnaire. After 3 and 6 months of follow-up, the proportion of participants who developed a mental disorder was calculated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Results: A total of 1,101 participants were included in the analysis. At 3- and 6-month follow-up the observed frequency of mental disorders was 13.51% (115/851) and 24.30% (207/852), respectively, while the frequency estimates after missing data imputation were 13.95% and 23.78%, respectively. After controlling for confounders, logistic regression analysis showed that participants with a lower education level (p =.034), a shorter duration of journey (p =.057) and arriving from countries with war-related contexts (p =.017), were more at risk of developing mental disorders. Psychological distress (p =.004), depression (p =.001) and exposure to potentially traumatic events (p =.020) were predictors of mental disorder development. Conclusions: This study identified several risk factors for the development of mental disorders in asylum seekers and refugees, some of which may be the target of risk reduction policies. The identification of asylum seekers and refugees at increased risk of mental disorders should guide the implementation of focused preventative psychological interventions.

N2  - Introduction: Self-Help Plus (SH+) is a group-based psychological intervention developed by the World Health Organization for managing stress. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of SH+ in preventing mental disorders in refugees and asylum seekers in Western Europe. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 5 European countries. Refugees and asylum seekers with psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire score ≥3), but without a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) or ICD/10 diagnosis of mental disorder, as assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), were randomized to SH+ or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU). The primary outcome was the frequency of mental disorders with the MINI at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of mental disorders at postintervention, self-identified problems, psychological symptoms, and other outcomes. Results: Four hundred fifty-nine individuals were randomly assigned to SH+ or ETAU. For the primary outcome, we found no difference in the frequency of mental disorders at 6 months (Cramer V = 0.007, p = 0.90, RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.52–1.78), while the difference significantly favored SH+ at after the intervention (secondary outcome, measured within 2 weeks from the last session; Cramer V = 0.13, p = 0.01, RR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.29–0.87). Conclusions: This is the first randomized indicated prevention study with the aim of preventing the onset of mental disorders in asylum seekers and refugees in Western Europe. As a prevention effect of SH+ was not observed at 6 months, but rather after the intervention only, modalities to maintain its beneficial effect in the long term need to be identified.
