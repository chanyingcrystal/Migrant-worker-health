1. Learning Circles: 
Learning Circles (LCs) occurred twice weekly, in two hourmeetings between refugee adults and children and undergraduate students. LCs began with cultural exchange, which provided a forum for refugees and undergraduates to learn from each other through discussions aided by interpreters. Cultural exchange was facilitated by one undergraduate and one refugee each evening who worked together to decide upon and develop a topic of interest. Discussion topics included healthcare, safety issues, labor unions and worker rights, roles of men and women in the U.S., treatment of people of African descent in America, and performance arts including music, drumming, and dancing. The second component of the LCs was one-on-one learning, during which undergraduates and participants worked in pairs. Refugees chose areas of learning such as English competency or completing job applications. Each refugee studied with the same student every time, fostering the development of comfort and trust. Undergraduates were also engaged in learning about the culture, experiences, and knowledge of refugee.

2. Advocacy: 
The advocacy component was adapted from the Community Advocacy model. Based on relationships formed in the LCs, each student worked with one or two refugee partners to engage in mutual advocacy. They spent a minimum of two to four hours each week together to mobilize community resources to address unmet needs identified by the refugee partner. Transferring advocacy skills to the refugees was emphasized so that increased access to resources would be sustained after involvement in the program ended.

Thus, the current study provides additional preliminary evidence that addressing psychosocial stressors through the creation of space for mutual learning, development of reciprocal relationships, and valuing of refugees’ strengths, concurrent with the mobilisation of needed resources may be important in improving quality of life and psychological well-being.

The positive findings regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the intervention suggest that the RWP model can be adapted for ethnically and linguistically diverse refugees who resettle in different parts of the United States.","Acquisition of new skills and knowledge;

Participants attended 6-sessions of the intervention within the span of 6 weeks. The support groups were co-led by a female clinical psychologist and a female promotora (women who were current/former migrant farmworkers that are trained as health educators). Each group leader was bilingual and bicultural. 

The psychologist presented educational material on the relevant weekly topic which would open up the conversation/discussion among the support groups. The topics covered include: (1) understanding and coping against stress, anxiety and depression; (2) increasing hopefulness and self-esteem (“developing one’s own style and personality”); (3) empowering group members to better individuate, assert themselves, and succeed in the larger society; (4) family issues related to nurturance and childrearing, discipline, family functioning and communication, and acculturation gaps (i.e., children acculturating at a quicker pace than parents); and (5) understanding and recovering from domestic violence and other traumatic experiences.

Group leaders also used CBT techniques such as imaginal and in vivo exposure; assertiveness training; cognitive strategies such as problem solving, cognitive restructuring, and learning to recognize factors that contribute to stress, anxiety, and depression; and behavioral strategies such as increasing group members’ engagement in pleasurable activities, positive activity scheduling, and the bolstering of coping skills.

To be more culturally appropriate, the intervention was delivered in Spanish and promotoras were used as a group leader. The intervention was delivered in a local church. Participants were involved in the decision-making process and an emphasis was made on culturally-valued interactions. During these sessions, women were encouraged to talk about their difficulties as a farmworker and discuss about different topics.",Migrant workers ,Group based ,"6 sessions, one per week","pre, post, 6 month followup","Stress; Anxiety; Depression; Other: hopelessness, self esteem","",80 ,25.6,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,75.3,19.1,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,34.4,14.1,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",64.5,21.4,n/a,n/a,"","",n/a,n/a,"","",n/a,n/a,"","",n/a,n/a,16.6,8.0,n/a,n/a,"","",n/a,n/a,"","",n/a,n/a,"","",n/a,n/a,"","",n/a,n/a,"","",n/a,n/a,"",58.5,18.1,4,66.7%,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,65.0,6.4,4,66.7%,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,15.5,4.7,4,66.7%,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"According to the criteria set forth by Jacobson and Truax (1991), 83 % of the women achieved clinically significant pretreatment-posttreatment change and end-state functioning for migrant farmworker stress and depressive symptoms.

Module 3: Strengthening Social Networking Skill includes education on building up cross-cultural social networking skills and practicing exercises to identify social networking techniques.

Module 5: Create a Healthy Family Environment includes sharing three lessons and encouraging family members to practice relevant health tips and do exercises together as a family event.

The SEW program is a community-based, culturally tailored health education and problem solving activity (60 min), breathing exercises, and yoga (60 min) in a group setting once weekly for 5 weeks. We implemented our program using a participatory group discussion approach, including once a week face-to-face educational sessions, role play, yoga practices (20 simple low-risk yoga poses), and breathing exercises,  at the training hall of a local church.

The first hour of each session included: a brief health education lesson, a small group discussion identifying culturally tailored problem-solving approaches, and making a plan for a daily practice of at least three problem solving measures that would help reduce stress or build up necessary skills for the remained of the week. In the second hour, participants enjoyed breath-ing exercises and yoga. A team of facilitators, including a bilingual researcher (first author), community leaders (third and fourth authors), a holistic nurse, and a certified yoga trainer, implemented all sessions.

Educational Materials were provided to participants, covering culturally tailored stress management; strengthen-ing coping, communication, and social networking skills; and pictograph and video recordings on breathing exercises and yoga practices. Participants were encouraged to practice problem-solving measures, do breathing exercises and yoga together with their family members, and record their home practices in homework logbooks.

A  tailored  counselling programme  was  devised  for  each patient. The education sessions and interventions were conducted by one Moroccan–Arabic health educator, one Moroccan–Berber health educator and two Turkish health educators. All the health educators   had   been   trained   to   deal   with   the   topic   of psychosomatic  disorders,  had  been  given  an  introduction  to mental  health  care  facilities,  and  they  had  been  trained  to demonstrate relaxation exercises and to facilitate role-playing in the group education sessions.",Migrant workers ,Individual based; Group based ,Mean intervention duration per patient was 12 months,"T1: Baseline Interview, T2: Post-Test Interview","Other: Perceived Stressful Situations, Knowledge of the relationship between pain and stress, Social Support, Mental Health","",5.41,2.98,n/a,n/a,5.31,2.44,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,228 (SCL-90; for general mental health),70.9,n/a,n/a,244 (SCL-90; for general mental health),61.8,n/a,n/a,"",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"",4.82,2.97,n/a,n/a,5.35,3.03,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,211 (SCL-90; for general mental health),65.2,n/a,n/a,245 (SCL-90; for general mental health),72.1,n/a,n/a,"",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Many patients referred by their GP showed a need for the migrant health education intervention.

In Denmark,  as in other European countries, the proportion of immigrants in the cleaning industry has increased markedly in recent years. In 2000, workers with immigrant background represented approximately 23% of the Danish labour force employed as traditional cleaners. This percentage increased to 35% in 2006, and in larger cities the number is markedly higher

Individual semi-structured interviews, assisted by professional interpreters when necessary, were conducted with the cleaners at their work place three weeks before and three weeks after the intervention. An interview guide was developed which consisted of open-ended questions designed  to solicit information about the cleaners’ background and their perceptions of interaction and collaboration with colleagues before the intervention as well as their expectations in regard to the intervention. After the intervention, the cleaners were asked to evaluate the different intervention components, and to tell about their experiences as well as their overall perception of the outcome of the intervention.

",Grounded theory,"All the cleaners employed at the school where the intervention was carried out, ten women and four men, participated in the intervention. They originated from six different countries including Romania, Thailand, Turkey, Serbia, Philippines, and Denmark.

Six of the immigrant cleaners had lived and worked in Denmark for less than two years (newcomers) and six had been in Denmark for more than ten years (long-term residents). Two cleaners were native Danes.",All cleaners employed at the school where the intervention carried out,n/a,Voluntary,14,"",4 (28.6),n/a,4 (28.6),"",n/a,n/a,"",n/a,n/a,"",n/a,n/a,"",n/a,n/a,14 (100.0),n/a,14 (100.0),"1. Work-related Danish lessons for cleaners with immigrant background (3 h per week for 6 months): The aim of the course was for the cleaners to be able to read the cleaning plans and talk to colleagues, supervisors, and customers about cleaning equipment, detergents, materials, and cleaning plans. Furthermore the cleaners should be able, in Danish, to call in sick and to talk about everyday life. The lessons included group work.

2. Vocational training courses held by an Adult Vocational Training Centre on working techniques, detergents, surfaces, and safety (8 half days): The courses were carried out in Danish; however, instructions about safety were interpreted into relevant languages. The lessons included group work. 

3. Workshop on job satisfaction and teamwork (2 half days): The purpose of the workshop was to become aware of the benefits of working in a multi-cultural group of employees and to improve well-being and job satisfaction. 

Through exercises, games, and conversation the workshop focused on the importance of: • Attitudes towards work • “The good workday” • Recognition and praise • Increased community among colleagues (e.g., through role plays on the difference in being met with recognition or indifference) The workshop also included activities which were not related to work such as being taught a dance. 

4. Staff meetings with increased frequency: The meetings focused on the implementation of the intervention and on topical topics such as how the collaboration on washing of cleaning cloths could be improved.

According to the interviews with the cleaners, the intervention had led to improved communication, trust, and collaboration. These findings are supported by the questionnaire where social support from supervisor and colleagues, social community, trust, and teamwork seem to have improved together with meaning of work, rewards, and emotional demands. The design of the intervention may provide inspiration for future psychosocial work environment interventions at multi-ethnic work places.","1. Interaction and Collaboration before the Intervention

Mr. M was a 57-year-old married man who contacted a speciality anxiety clinic in a university setting seeking social anxiety treatment. At the time of the intake, he reported that he experienced social anxiety in some situations such as talking in front of a group of people, writing in front of others, speaking with unfamiliar people, and asking others to change their behavior. In addition, he stated that he frequently avoided the aforementioned situations because of his social anxiety. The client reported that writing in front of others at his work caused the most interference in his daily life. 

Mr. M reported that he was born in Central America but that he immigrated to the United States as an adult more than 30 years prior to treatment. He stated that he had experienced problematic social anxiety since his childhood in Central America. As a child, he moved from his hometown, where the majority of people spoke an indigenous language, to a larger city where most people spoke Spanish. He described feeling worried that others might think poorly of him because he did not speak Spanish as well as they did.Mr. M reported that his social anxiety continued through his adulthood and that he used alcohol frequently to cope with his anxiety. He stated that he became sober and used a self-help book to address his social anxiety. However, he indicated that he needed therapy to truly overcome his anxiety

2. Ling was a 32-year-old female who emigrated from China to the United States approximately 3 years prior to the diagnostic evaluation. She had obtained a doctorate in the natural sciences before moving for work. She was single at the time of the diagnostic evaluation but married during treatment.

Ling contacted a specialty anxiety clinic in a university setting due to problems related to self-reported social anxiety and depression. She reported that she had experienced at least some social anxiety since she was a child growing up in China. She described being reserved in school and not having close social contacts. However, she believed that her social anxiety became much more severe when she moved to the United States from China. She indicated that she had not anticipated that a strong interpersonal component would be important for her career, and her distress regarding social anxiety became elevated once this became apparent to her. She also reported that she had been experiencing intermittent feelings of depression since moving from China.",n/a,"Two  culturally diverse clients who immigrated to the United States, one from Central America and one from China, for whom English was not the primary language",n/a,n/a,Clinic patients,2,"",1(50),n/a,1(50),n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Cognitive-behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder.

","Mr. M's Case: 

1. Follow-Up: (During telephone contact 1 month after the final session, Mr. M reported that he was doing well and continued to attend social events. Approximately 8 months later, the therapist called the client to seek permission to use his case in this article. He informed the therapist that he felt as though he had maintained treatment gains in terms of a reduction in anxiety and avoidance. No formal assessment was done. 

- The clinical severity of Mr. M's social anxiety decreased 4 points 
- Mr M’s final score on the SASCI indicated that he felt as though his social anxiety was much less than when he started treatment, even though his initial scores were very low.
- Mr. M’s scores on general measures of social anxiety decreased over the course of treatment as well. Mr. M’s scores prior to treatment of 38 on the BFNE, 43 on the SIAS, and 26 on the SPS at the start of treatment suggested high levels of social anxiety. At posttreatment, his scores were in the average-to-low range (BFNE = 23, SIAS = 11, and SPS = 3), compared with community normative values (Heimberg et al., 1992; Weeks et al., 2005). These changes are consistent with the improvement seen on the Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy.)

Ling's Case: 
- The clinical severity of her social anxiety decreased 2 points from 6 to 4. This indicates that her symptoms of social anxiety were still clinically severe but had decreased over the course of treatment.
- For the majority of situations, her anxiety and avoidance decreased somewhat. However, it is interesting that her avoidance increased for both initiating small talk and maintaining conversa-tions with coworkers. This is consistent with her report during the termination session that she continued to engage in covert avoidance behavior for these two domains. Also, it is unclear why Ling rated that her anxiety increased at posttreatment for initiating small talk with coworkers, which is inconsistent with her self-report during session and on homework assignments.
- Her BFNE scores decreased from 53 (pre-treatment) to 48 (posttreatment), which is clinically significant and indicative of high levels of social anxiety
- Her scores on the BDI-II decreased dra-matically over the course of treatment. Her score prior to the first treatment session (31) indicates that she was experiencing severe depressive symptoms prior to treatment, whereas her posttreat-ment score (10) indicates that she was experiencing only mild depressive symptoms at the end of treatment.
- At posttreatment, Ling was still experiencing SAD, though there is some evidence of reduction in severity compared with prior to beginning treatment. Also, she no longer met diagnostic criteria for MDD.",""
